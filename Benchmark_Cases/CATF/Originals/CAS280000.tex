\subsection{Cost Category 28: Digital twin / Simulator }

Simulator(s): This account includes the development of new digital twins or simulators.  Digital twins play a pivotal role in enhancing the safety, efficiency, and overall operational effectiveness of nuclear power plants. By creating real-time, high-fidelity digital replicas of these complex facilities, operators can continuously monitor and simulate plant behavior, predict potential issues, and optimize maintenance schedules. This technology enables proactive decision-making, reduces downtime, and ensures compliance with stringent safety standards, ultimately contributing to the reliable and sustainable 
operation of nuclear power plants.\\

Cost basis is the estimated annual license fee of C280000 M USD for a comprehensive digital twin platform for the fusion power plant, based on quotes from nTtau Digital LTD.
