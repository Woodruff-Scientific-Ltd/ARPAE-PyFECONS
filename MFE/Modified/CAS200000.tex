\section{Cost Category 20: Capitalized Direct Costs (CDC)}

We borrow all of the two-digit cost accounts from the GENIV EMWG Guidelines, which depart slightly from the IAEA 2001 guidelines.  Each subcategory is broken out separately.  In the EMWG Guidelines document, cost category 20 is designated as "Capitalized Direct Costs" (CDC). This category is a key component of the overall cost structure for energy plant projects and includes various essential expenditures directly related to the construction and commissioning of a plant. Typically, such costs encompass all direct expenses incurred in the physical construction of the plant, including materials, labor, and any other resources directly associated with the construction activities.
