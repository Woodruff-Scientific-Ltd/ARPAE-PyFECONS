\subsection{Cost Category 29: Contingency on Direct Capital Costs}

This account includes the assessment of additional cost that might be necessary to achieve the desired confidence level for the direct costs not to be exceeded. Contingency is usually applied at an aggregated level, although its determination may include applying contingencies to individual high-cost-impact items in the estimate.  Contingency factors range from 1 to 0.05 depending on the maturity of the subsystem, so for a FOAK Fusion Pilot Plant, the factor may be as high as 1 for all of the major subsystems included in the fusion power core, but closer to 0.05 for systems in the Balance of Plant.  \\

Here we apply a factor of 0.1 to all of the systems in Cost Category 20, giving a total of  0 M. {\color{blue} However for NOAK, we omit this cost.}
