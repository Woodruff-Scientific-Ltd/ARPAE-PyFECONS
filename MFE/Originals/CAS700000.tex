\subsection{Cost Category 70: Annualized O\&M Cost (AOC)}

The Operations and Maintenance (O\&M) costs was previously estimated to be 2 \% of the direct cost, assessed annually.  The O\&M cost depends on the system complexity and the requirements of regulations, security and maintenance. The costs are computed based on look-up tables, such as the one shown in Fig. \ref{fig:statista} at 60 USD per kilowatt-year.

\begin{verbatim} 
C_OM = 60 * PE * 1000 = C700000  
\end{verbatim} 

Annualized O\&M costs are \$ C700000 M.
