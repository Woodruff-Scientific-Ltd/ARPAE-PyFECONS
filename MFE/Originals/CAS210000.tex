\subsection{Cost Category 21: Structures and Improvements}

This account covers all direct costs associated with the construction and provision of physical plant buildings and structures. Key elements include the reactor, turbine, electrical equipment, and cooling system structures, along with site improvements, facilities, and miscellaneous building work. The costs for these structures, especially the heat island and turbine buildings, represent a significant portion of the total cost of the facility. For instance, the Heat Island Building is noted for its compact design, thick radiation shielding walls, and inclusion of access corridors and hot cell, leading to its estimated cost. The Turbine Building, housing turbines and auxiliary equipment, is also a major cost component, with its size and cost dependent on the size of turbines and equipment. Additional facilities like the Hot Cell, Service Water, and Fuel Handling Buildings, Control Room, On-Site AC Power, and other administrative and service buildings are also included, each having distinct scaling factors and cost estimates based on their specific functions and requirements within the power plant. We provide a detailed cost estimation approach for each of these buildings, reflecting their critical role in the overall construction and operation of the energy plant.\\

 \textbf{2020 Update} 
\emph{Scope: } 
Site preparation and yard work, reactor building, turbine building, security building and gatehouse, control and administrative buildings, maintenance shop, any other site structures and facilities. 
 \emph{Previous values:} CAD calculations for building volumes and concrete volumes multiplied by materials costs. 
Min \$373/kW, Average \$606/kW, Max \$1,142/kW. 
\emph{Reduction strategies: } 
Minimal reactor building size and wall/ceiling thickness (while fully preserving safety); minimal volumes for concrete and other materials (expensive concrete vs. inexpensive soil or sand, perhaps as inner fill material within metal or concrete walls); avoidance of unnecessary buildings in plant design; reuse of buildings if an existing power plant site; modular construction, as in Wartsila Modular Block. 
\emph{Updated value: } 
Average of previous value reduced by 25 \% with implementation of feasible strategies listed above. \$606/kW $\times$ - 0.25 = \$470/kW, giving a total for CAS21 of C210000 M \$. 
%\emph{2023 Updated value: } 
%Buildings now built using a bottoms up approach, totaling 450.0 M \$.
