This Github contains a branch for each base case, and one for the benchmark cases. Each branch contains the code in a .ipynb file, and a file named 'Text.txt' with the corresponding Google Drive with the .tex file templates that get hydrated when the code is run, and an overelaf document which acts as the interface between the code and the text, and where the final report is compiled.

1. Download the code notebook .ipynb file
2. Open the Overleaf link corresponding to that code (find overleafs in the corresponding case file named 'Text.txt').
3. Enter inputs in the code, and run all cells. This will hydrate the 'originals' templates.
4. Go to overleaf and 'pull' from github into overleaf
5. Run the 'modified' main .tex file
6. A hydrated report should have compiled

7. To edit the text, edit the 'originals' .tex files corresponding to the cost category you would like to edit.
8. Go to 'Github' pn the left tab, and 'push'
9. Restart code, and repeat steps 3-6
