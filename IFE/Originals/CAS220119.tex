\subsubsection*{Cost Category 22.01.19 Scheduled Replacement Cost}

A key component of Cost Category 22.01 is the \textit{Scheduled Replacement Cost}.  This cost was previously included in the annualized costs when computing the LCOE, however, the LCOE annualized Cost Categories (70, 80 and 90) now have rules that exclude capitalized costs - the components in the heat island will be capitalized as they will be purchased at the time of construction of the heat island so they are ready for installation on a schedule to replace components before failure.  This cost involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Component Replacement. Regularly scheduled replacement of components, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and safety.  Only some components are ever considered `life of plant', and this may well evolve to be all components in some fusion heat islands, however, very likely all components in Cost Category 22 will require scheduled replacement for the FOAK.
    \item Replacement Schedule. Components such as those in the first wall and the blanket are replaced every replacementT years.  Obviously for a FOAK power plant the replacement schedule may be must faster than for a NOAK system, and so this will be a major cost driver in systems that require regular replacement.
\end{enumerate}

The annual replacement cost is calculated to be \$C220119M, ensuring continuous operation without major downtimes.
