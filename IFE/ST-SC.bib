abstract = "A novel approach using multiple scintillator detectors is applied to measure temporally- and spatially-resolved neutron production in the Fusion Z-pinch Experiment (FuZE) device, a Sheared-Flow Stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch. Diagnosing neutron production from FuZE is important for determining if fusion is thermonuclear and whether the FuZE device can be scaled toward reactor conditions. Absolute yields of up to 2Â ÃÂ 105 neutrons per discharge are measured with calibrated plastic scintillator detectors operating in pulse-counting mode. Neutron emission durations of up to âŒ 8ÎŒs are inferred by recording the time difference between the first and last pulses for each discharge. Multiple scintillator detectors located at different positions with respect to the fusing plasma are used to demonstrate that the axial extent of the neutron producing region is comparable to the device volume. Scintillator detectors are well-suited as neutron diagnostics for FuZE and other plasma devices with similar yields and emission durations. Increasing the neutron yield, duration, and volume of the neutron emitting region within the plasma column are significant experimental objectives for FuZE."

  abstract  = {For several decades many have studied or conducted experiments to drive magnetic fields into metallic conducting materials. Examples include designs for electrically exploded fuses, exploding wires to generate high energy plasmas, and of course heavy metal liners as kinetic drivers for hydrodynamic experiments. When the material melts the surface can develop highly unstable dynamics. One of the most common results is the onset and growth of spatial perturbations taking on the form of spike and bubble like structures. This is usually identified as Magneto-Raleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability. A clear example is when excessive current is applied to accelerate a near normal density thick metal liner to velocities approaching 1.0 cm/ÎŒsec or greater. Yet we have observed several experiments where melting of the liner was present but the outside liner surface was observed to remained stable (B-0.5 to 1.3 MG). Analysis of this and other cases compared to MHD simulations enabled us to examine this phenomenon under a variety of conditions. While the majority of the cases still are fundamentally acceleration driven instability of a fluid interface, other phenomenon have been observed to play a significant role such as the effect of liquid/vapor phase change at the surface. Additionally, this suggests there may be drive conditions that can maintain the aluminum at conditions well away from the saturated liquid line until the conditions are well above the triple point in aluminum. There are some indications that this may reduce or delay the MRT like instabilities. However excessive drive that pressurizes the melted layer too much produces unfavorable gradients in the material that grossly aggravate the traditional MRT instabilities. In this talk we will examine in detail the effects of EOS structure, conductivity dependence on state properties (e.g. density and temperature), and the magnitude and time dependence of the driving magnetic field on the evolution of surface conditions. Based on these observations we propose that controlling the surface stability may depend on careful adjustment of time scales associated with the driving waveform and kinetics of the liner in order to control the path in phase space (EOS) the material follows.},

  abstract  = {A soluble model of the development of the linear perturbations about a time-varying state of a compressible medium is presented. A Lagrangian description is employed to rederive the equations for the self-similar motion of an ideal fluid and to obtain the linearized equations of motion for perturbations about a general time-varying basic state. The resulting formalism is applied in cylindrical geometry to calculate the growth of flute-like modes associated with a similarity solution modeling the implosion and expansion of a fluid liner. A complete solution is obtained for the perturbed motion. The only modes for which the perturbation amplitudes grow faster than the unperturbed liner radius during both implosion and expansion are divergence- and curl-free. Numerical and analytical results are obtained for these and shown to reduce, in the short-wavelength limit, to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability found previously for incompressible time-independent basic states. In addition, a new kind of instability is found: a class of overstable internal modes (sound waves), which are `pumped up' in amplitude during implosion, but decay during the expansion phase.},

  abstract  = {A new concept in imploding liner plasma compression is described in which a liquid metal liner is imploded by pistons driven by high-pressure gas, and stability of the inner surface against Rayleigh-Taylor modes is achieved by rotation. The principle has been demonstrated by using a water liner to compress air. This `captive liner' offers the possibility of stable, reversible implosion-expansion cycles in which the plasma energy is recovered into the driving system, leading to reactor cycles with low Q and, hence, small size. A new method of setting up closed-field confinement geometries inside a liner using a rotating electron beam is described. Plasma currents induced by the beam provide initial plasma heating and generate the containment geometry. Persistence of plasma currents 100 times longer than the beam duration has been observed. Development of these methods could lead to a very compact thermonuclear reactor operating in the manner of a reciprocating engine.},

The state variables at minimum radius (turnaround) are computed as functions of pf, the peak payload pressure and uinfin, the velocity the liner would attain if allowed to expand without restraint. For each choice of pf and uinfin, the rotational speed is chosen to just stabilize the Rayleigh-Taylor modes at the liner-payload interface. The acceleration of the inner surface is largest immediately prior to turnaround, so that the initial rotational speed required for stabilization is close to that for an equivalent incompressible liner. Near turnaround the inner portion of the liner becomes significantly compressed, making the efficiency with which liner kinetic energy is transferred to the payload considerably less than that for an incompressible liner. The liner compression provided at turnaround alters the implosion dynamics and creates a pressure pulse propagating outward, analogous to a `water hammer'. An additional result of compression is a slower rebound speed after turnaround, compared with the implosion speed.},

The repetition rate of the controlled implosion-plasma compression event and the flow rate of the linear material through the reactor are adjusted to maintain a linear temperature suitable for operating a steam-electric plant. It is shown that Q, the ratio of nuclear energy produced per pulse to the energy supplied to implode the liner, is on the order of unity for economical reactor-sized LINUS systems. The reactor size is calculated for a power output of 700 MW(e) at a pulse rate of 1 Hz. Prototype controlled-liner implosion systems are also described.},

Three types of experiments developing FRC formation, injection, and compression are described: field-compression, FRC formation-translation-capture, and FRC formation- translation-capture-compression. All involve the generation of primarily axial guide and mirror magnetic fields with ~2 Tesla peak fields, using ~5 ms rise time discharges into 9 pulsed magnet coils surrounding the liner implosion portion of the device. The field compression and FRC compression experiments use 12 MA, 4.5 MJ Shiva Star capacitor bank axial discharges to drive implosions of 30 cm tall, 10 cm diameter, 1 mm thick Al shells or liners. The FRC capture experiments are a pre-requisite for the destructive FRC compression experiments. All FRC experiments use 3 capacitor discharges into a segmented theta coil surrounding the FRC formation region to establish a bias field, accomplish pre-ionization of deuterium gas, and provide the reverse field main theta discharge (~1 MA) which forms the FRC. This is aided by two cusp field discharges. The guide and mirror fields enable translation of the FRC and its capture in the liner interior region. Diagnostics include pulsed power (current and voltage), magnetic field, field exclusion, laser interferometry, imaging and spectroscopy, radiography, and both activation and time-of-flight neutron detection. Design features and operating parameters are guided by 2D-MHD simulations.},

  abstract  = {Magnetized target fusion (MTF) is a means to compress plasmas to fusion conditions that uses magnetic fields to greatly reduce electron thermal conduction, thereby greatly reducing compression power density requirements. The compression is achieved by imploding the boundary, a metal shell. This effort pursues formation of the field-reversed configuration (FRC) type of magnetized plasma, and implosion of the metal shell by means of magnetic pressure from a high current flowing through the shell. We reported previously on experiments demonstrating that we can use magnetic pressure from high current capacitor discharges to implode long cylindrical metal shells (liners) with size, symmetry, implosion velocity, and overall performance suitable for compression of FRCs. We also presented considerations of using deformable liner-electrode contacts of Z-pinch geometry liners or theta pinch-driven liners, in order to have axial access to inject FRCs and to have axial diagnostic access. Since then, we have experimentally implemented the Z-pinch discharge driven deformable liner-electrode contact, obtained full axial coverage radiography of such a liner implosion, and obtained 2Âœ dimensional MHD simulations for a variety of profiled thickness long cylindrical liners. The radiographic results indicate that at least 16 times radial compression of the inner surface of a 0.11-cm-thick Al liner was achieved, with a symmetric implosion, free of instability growth in the plane of the symmetry axis. We have also made progress in combining 2Âœ-D MHD simulations of FRC formation with imploding liner compression of FRCs. These indicate that capture of the injected FRC by the imploding liner can be achieved with suitable relative timing of the FRC formation and liner implosion discharges.},

MIF reduces required precision in the implosion and the convergence ratio. Since 2008 (Wurden et al 2008 IAEA 2008 Fusion Energy Conf. (Geneva, Switzerland, 13-18 October) IC/P4-13 LA-UR-08-0796) and since our prior refereed publication on this topic (Degnan et al 2008 IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 36 80), AFRL and LANL have developed further one version of MIF. We have (1) reliably formed, translated, and captured field reversed configurations (FRCs) in magnetic mirrors inside metal shells or liners in preparation for subsequent compression by liner implosion; (2) imploded a liner with interior magnetic mirror field, obtaining evidence for compression of a 1.36 T field to 540 T; (3) performed a full system experiment of FRC formation, translation, capture, and imploding liner compression operation; (4) identified by comparison of 2D-MHD simulation and experiments factors limiting the closed-field lifetime of FRCs to about half that required for good liner compression of FRCs to multi-keV, 1019 ion cm-3, high energy density plasma (HEDP) conditions; and (5) designed and prepared hardware to increase that closed-field FRC lifetime to the required amount. Those lifetime experiments are now underway, with the goal of at least doubling closed-field FRC lifetimes and performing FRC implosions to HEDP conditions this year. These experiments have obtained imaging evidence of FRC rotation, and of initial rotation control measures slowing and stopping such rotation. Important improvements in fidelity of simulation to experiment have been achieved, enabling improved guidance and understanding of experiment design and performance.},

The radiographic results indicate that at least 16 times radial compression of the inner surface of a 0.11 cm thick Al liner was achieved, with a symmetric implosion free of instability growth. We have also made progress in combining 2D-MHD simulations of FRC formation with imploding liner compression of FRCs. These indicate that capture of the injected FRC by the imploding liner can be achieved with suitable relative timing of the FRC formation and liner implosion discharges.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. The AFRL Shiva Star capacitor bank (1300 ÎŒF, up to 120 kV) used typically at 4 to 5 MJ stored energy, 10 to 15 MA current, 10 ÎŒs current rise time, has been used to drive metal shell (solid liner) implosions for compression of axial magnetic fields to multi-megagauss levels, suitable for compressing magnetized plasmas to Magneto-Inertial Fusion (MIF) conditions. MIF approaches use embedded magnetic field to reduce thermal conduction relative to inertial confinement fusion (ICF). MIF substantially reduces required implosion speed and convergence. Using a profiled thickness liner enables large electrode apertures and the injection of a field-reversed configuration (FRC) version of a magnetized plasma ring. Using a longer capture region than originally used, the FRC trapped flux lifetime was made comparable to implosion time and an integrated compression test was conducted. The FRC was compressed cylindrically by more than a factor of ten, with density up more than 100x, to >1018 cm-3 (a world FRC record), but temperatures were only in the range of 300-400 eV, compared to the intended several keV. Although compression to megabar pressures was inferred by the observed time and rate of liner rebound, we learned that heating rate during the first half of the compression was not high enough compared to the normal FRC decay rate. Principal diagnostics for this experiment were soft x-ray imaging, soft x-ray diodes, and neutron measurements. Measures that could double the trapped flux lifetime and pre-compression temperature of the FRC will be discussed.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. NumerEx's Stabilized Liner Compressor (SLC) is a mechanical driver that rotates and implodes a liquid metal vortex - our liner - to compress magnetic fields and plasma to fusion energy densities. The rotation conquers drive asymmetries, and makes the liner rebound for immediate reuse after the implosion. The liquid liner will serve as a first wall in a reactor, absorbing neutrons, protecting other components, and breeding tritium. The time is right for SLC because magnetized plasma target lifetimes are increasing dramatically. However SLC's design poses significant challenges. We must make the implosion fast enough, the structure strong enough, and the flow repeatable enough to recapture the liquid liner. We will surmount these challenges first in a fully functional laboratory-scale model designed to implode a 10 cm diameter cylindrical volume to 1 cm diameter in 25 ÎŒs. We are designing this device using multi-physics computer simulation. We are using 2Âœ-d MACH2, with its 2-d domain and â/âÎž assumed zero but all three components of each vector field included, as is essential for problems with fluid rotation. The driving energy in SLC comes from a plenum of high pressure gas released by fast valves to a chamber behind a free annular piston. The piston pushes on low melting-point liquid metal that converts the piston's swept volume to the implosion of an inward-facing rotating free surface. Our simulations follow the compressible motion of the high pressure gas into the chamber and the elastic behavior of the piston as it transmits the pressure to the liquid metal, producing an initially nearly incompressible fluid flow. As the free surface of the liquid liner is driven to smaller radius and higher radial and azimuthal velocity, our simulations capture the increasingly compressible fluid behavior. We will show simulations of low pressure experiments done with water and with eutectic NaK at NRL in the late 1970's. The relatively complete data from the water experiment are well matched by our simulations in radius and symmetry. The NaK data are less complete and less well matched. We will show very high pressure simulations of Na and NaK in geometries similar to those used at NRL, with similarly symmetric results. We will also show simulations of axially longer geometries that fail to achieve the necessary symmetry to show that this is clearly a work in progress!},

  abstract  = {MagLIF is a fusion concept using a Z-pinch implosion to reach thermonuclear fusion. In current experiments, the implosion is driven by the Z-machine using 19 MA of electrical current with a rise time of 100 ns. MagLIF requires an initial axial magnetic field of 30 T to reduce heat losses to the liner wall during compression and to confine alpha particles during fusion burn. This field is generated well before the current ramp starts and needs to penetrate the transmission lines of the pulsed-power generator, as well as the liner itself. Consequently, the axial field rise time must exceed hundreds of microseconds. Any coil capable of being submitted to such a field for that length of time is inevitably bulky. The space required to fit the coil near the liner, increases the inductance of the load. In turn, the total current delivered to the load decreases since the voltage is limited by driver design. Yet, the large amount of current provided by the Z-machine can be used to produce the required 30 T field by tilting the return current posts surrounding the liner, eliminating the need for a separate coil. However, the problem now is the field penetration time, across the liner wall. This paper discusses why skin effect arguments do not hold in the presence of resistivity gradients. Numerical simulations show that fields larger than 30 T can diffuse across the liner wall in less than 60 ns, demonstrating that external coils can be replaced by return current posts with optimal helicity.},

  abstract  = {An experiment to form, translate, and adiabatically compress plasmas in field-reversed configurations (FRC's) is now being designed at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM. This experiment is referred to as 'F-LINCX', for Formation, LINer Compression experiment. Over the past six years, the AFRL has been working in close collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory's FRC formation experiment, FRX-L. The AFRL experiment will reproduce the electrical properties of FRX-L to ensure that FRC's of similar parameters are formed. After formation, the FRC will be translated into the interior of a 10-cm diameter, 30-cm long aluminum solid liner, and the Shiva Star Capacitor Bank will be used to implode the liner and compress the FRC to magnetized target fusion (MTF) relevant densities and temperatures. Based upon FRX-L's present configuration, the FRC formation will require four separate capacitor banks. These banks include two slow rise-time banks to first establish a bias magnetic field in a 10-cm diameter, 36-to- 45-cm long theta discharge region and higher-intensity cusp fields at both ends of this region. Inside the theta discharge region will be a 50 to 100 mTorr deuterium pre- fill; a fast bank will pre-ionize this gas with an oscillating field comparable to the bias field. The last bank will drive a reverse-field in the theta discharge region with an amplitude approximately 10 times greater than the initial bias field. This bank will be crowbarred to lengthen decay time and FRC lifetime. To translate the FRC from the theta discharge region to the liner, one or two additional slow banks are needed to set up a guide field and a mirror field at the opposite end of the liner. The status of the F-LINCX experiment is discussed, along with relevant circuit and hardware designs for the capacitor banks. A proposed design for the integrated theta discharge, translation, and liner implosion regions is also presented.},

  abstract  = {Describes the formulation and computation of the adiabatic compression of a plasma in a realistic geometry such as a finite length thetas-pinch or imploding liner device. The assumption of cylindrical symmetry allows the authors to make use of the techniques originated by H. Grad (1976) for treating the resulting generalized differential equations. The nonlinear equilibrium equations are volume averaged over a flux surface and converted from PDEs to ODEs. This allows the adiabatic boundary conditions arising from the law of flux conservation to be taken into account. Calculations are presented for a field-reversed plasma configuration confined in either a finite length thetas-pinch or liner device. Compression is obtained by increasing the external confining coil current (flux compression) and thereby increasing the pinching field or by collapsing the external wall (liner) under the assumption of constant flux. In both cases it is assumed that compression occurs on a time scale which is longer than the pressure equilibration time. Results of radial and accompanying axial contraction are presented for a series of initial plasma profiles and beta under varying compression schemes.},

The code incorporates classical and anomalous transport coefficients, including drift ion cyclotron and lower hybrid instabilities with fluctuation amplitudes limited by shear and finite-beta stabilization. For a reactor-size imploding-liner configuration, heat conduction produces flat-topped temperature profiles and peaked densities. Scaling the reactor size down by a factor of five leads to a considerable increase of anomalous heat losses. A high-field, low-density buffer region near the wall is effective as a heat insulator, provided the field is sufficiently sheared there.},

  abstract  = {The injection of a Bz field inside a hollow imploding plasma liner has been proposed as a means of stabilizing the severe hydromagnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability which can occur in certain load geometries. This technique affects implosion characteristics in two significant ways: (1) distortion of field lines which are frozen into the electrodes, and (2) creation of multi-megagauss compressed fields on axis, altering the pinch characteristics of the plasma. The field line distortion induces a large Bz component near the electrode which effects the early development of the instability, while the accumulation of Bz field on axis affects the time at which the imploding plasma becomes hot and dense enough to be good radiation source. Both of these mechanisms are examined and their dependence of the magnitude of the initial injected field are also considered.},

The blades are electrically conducting and inclined to the radial direction. Its major function is either acceleration or deceleration of the liner in the azimuthal direction. This system enables one to exclude the rotary mechanism for the liner rotation. In this system, the liner is formed as an annular flow of a liquid metal (the waterfall concept). Results show that there is no significant difference of the energy cost for the stabilization compared with the earlier proposed system where a liner is rotated rigidly before implosion. Furthermore, the application of the rotating blade lattice makes it possible to reduce the rotational kinetic energy required for the stabilization at turn-around, where the lattice acts as an impeller in the initial liner rotation. There is an optimum blade angle to maximize the compressed magnetic field energy inside the liner for a given driving energy.},

  abstract  = {Discusses the stabilization problem in an imploding liner. (1) The dynamic stabilization. The possibility of the dynamic stabilization of liner surfaces is considered, where oscillating azimuthal magnetic fields are applied in addition to the driving and compressed axial fields. Then, oscillating axial currents are fed into the liner outer surface for the stabilization of it and the plasma surface for stabilization of the inner surface. Analytical results show that the stability can be reduced in this manner. (2) The implosion system with the blade lattice. Another method of stabilization by liner rotation has been proposed for the inner surface. The blade lattice is electrically conducting and has an angle of inclination to the radial direction. By using the fixed or initially rested blade lattice, the imploding liner can obtain the angular momentum for stabilization due to the angle of the blades. In this system, the high-speed rotary mechanism is not necessary and a liner can be formed as an annular flow of a liquid metal. The application of the rotating blade lattice makes it possible to reduce the rotational kinetic energy for the stabilization, where the angular momentum in the imploding liner which does not contribute to the stabilization is reduced by the angle of blades except that of the inner surface.},

In the above range of temperature, assuming the potassium to behave as a Bingham fluid, the kinematic elongational viscosity and the yield stress of solid potassium were found to be roughly 2~4 m2/s and 4~5 bar, respectively, based on the experimental data obtained from the collapsed liner. The perturbed motion due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability was also analyzed with account taken of the effect of viscosity. The kinematic shear viscosity obtained from the elongational viscosity is known to be of the order of 1 m2/s. The evidence would indicate that this shear viscosity is so large as to exert an inhibitive effect on the perturbations of higher mode (mgsim10) under the present experimental conditions.},

  abstract  = {To take advantage of the smaller scale, higher density regime of MIF an efficient and repeatable method for achieving the compressional heating required to reach fusion gain conditions is needed. The macro-particle (macron) formed liner compression of the field reversed configuration (FRC) provides such a method. The approach to be described employs an assemblage of small, gram scale, macrons to form a more massive liner that both radially and axially compresses and heats the FRC plasmoid to fusion conditions. The large liner energy (several MJ) required to compress the FRC is carried in the kinetic energy of the full array of macrons. The much smaller energy required for each individual macron is obtained by accelerating the macron to ~3 km/s which can be accomplished remotely using conventional inductive techniques. 3D numerical calculations demonstrate that macron convergence can form a coherent liner provided minimum velocity and timing accuracy is met. Experimental results have demonstrated that a cylindrical or spherical macron can be accelerated to velocity within 2 m/s and timing less than 1 microsecond. Initial testing of a 6-stage launcher yielded 280 m/s at a final coupling efficiency of greater than 40%.},

Plasmas 23, 102702 (2016)], where the target plasma created through Field reversed configuration (FRC) merging was compressed by an imploding liner driven by the pulsed-power driver. In the scheme, two initial FRCs (Field reversed configurations) are translated into the region where FRC merging occurs, bringing out the target plasma ready for compression. The simulations cover the three stages of the target creation process: formation, translation, and merging. The factors affecting the achieved target are analyzed numerically. The magnetic field gradient produced by the conical coils is found to determine how fast the FRC is accelerated to peak velocity and the collision merging occurs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that FRC merging can be realized by real coils with gaps showing nearly identical performance, and the optimized target by FRC merging shows larger internal energy and retained flux, which is more suitable for the MPFR concept.},

  abstract  = {Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) occupies an intermediate region between conventional Magnetic Fusion Energy (MFE) and Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE). A particular approach, extrapolated from the ongoing FRX-L experimental effort, involves the generation of a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) suitable for translation along an axial magnetic field and cylindrical-liner (i.e., converging flux conserver) implosion and pdV heating to burn conditions. The fusion gain, Q (ratio of DT fusion yield to the sum of initial liner kinetic energy plus plasma formation energy), sets the pulsed power-plant duty cycle. The modular power-plant embodiment recalls the Fast Liner Reactor (FLR) and shares stand-off and blast-mitigation features of the recent characterization of the Z-IFE. Recycle and economic remanufacture of destroyed front-end apparatus must be performed under tight cost constraints. A tin-lithium alloy is being investigated for multifunctional suitability as the liner, transmission-line, and primary coolant/breeder material. Key performance drivers are described.},

The machine is discharged axially through a cylindrical metal coated foil resulting in a foil plasma implosion. An axial magnetic field injected into the interior of the foil prior to implosion is greatly compressed by the imploding foil. Measurements of the resulting high magnetic fields are obtained using conventional dB/dt probes made of wire loops and also using Faraday probes. The cylindrical glass Faraday probes are traversed axially by a 1.5 watt argon laser beam. The Faraday rotation of the E vector in the laser beam is analyzed with a Polaroid filter and a subnanosecond response photodiode. Collimation and wavelength filters are used to increase the signal relative to the noise. Low Verdet constant glass was chosen for use in the Faraday probes. This choice eases the high frequency response characteristics required of the oscilloscope measuring the photodiode response. Comparison of the dB/dt and Faraday probe responses is given.},

  abstract  = {In the LINUS fusion reactor concept, a rotating liquid-metal liner is used for reversible mechanical compression of thermonuclear plasmas, where a vacuum-field `buffer' zone is used between the plasma and wall to reduce transport losses. The concept has the particular attractiveness of operating in a self-sustaining cycle if the alpha-particle burn energy equals all losses incurred during the liner implosion and re-expansion. A minimum LINUS size can be derived by requiring this burn energy to equal the energy lost to Ohmic dissipation associated with flux diffusion into the linear material and mechanical losses associated with the liner fluid mechanics. A one-dimensional plasma transport and burn code, including incompressible liner dynamics with heat transfer and temperature-dependent flux diffusion in the liquid metal, is used to model various LINUS configurations. Corrections due to compressibility are discussed using a simplified analytical model. Numerical coefficients are derived for simple LINUS scaling laws. The particular case of plasma contact with the liquid metal is studied to determine the effect on LINUS performance. Some thermal contact with the liner before peak compression does not kill the plasma burn, and can thus be allowed in compression scenarios.},

The RFTP operates at larger aspect ratio, higher beta, and larger current density than the Tokamak. It offers the possibility of a more compact reactor at lower power output, ignition by ohmic heating alone and easier accessibility and maintenance. The FLX represents an extreme of the linear pinch in which a thin metal shell is imploded in a few mus by a fast-rising poloidal field to compress a plasma to pressures of ~10 megabars. Recent studies indicate acceptable energy gains for small systems with lengths lsim0.3 m and yields of a few hundred MJ. The main physics problem of the LX is to overcome particle-flow and thermal conduction out the ends. Assuming the former to be eliminated by means of material end plugs or multiple mirrors, thermal conduction allows ntausime1015 sec/cm3 for a B2L product of approximately 2times103 T2-km. This is also the threshold for DT plasma ignition against thermal and bremsstrahlung losses.},

Hollow rotating relativistic electron beams with currents exceeding the Alfven current can be propagated inside conducting tubes in the absence of an applied magnetic field. When the beam is injected into hydrogen gas at 100-200 mtorr, the radial equilibrium is determined by the balance of centrifugal and magnetic forces, the magnetic fields being generated by the beam itself and by the currents induced in the tube wall. Since the axial flux is zero, the axial fields inside and outside the beam are in opposite directions. The beam ionizes the neutral gas and creates a plasma whose conductivity is sufficient to `freeze in' the magnetic field after the beam has left the system. This magnetic field confines the plasma in a reversed-field configuration, which persists for a time determined by the resistive decay of the plasma currents. A theoretical model of beam propagation, and experimental results, is presented.},

  abstract  = {A conceptual design is presented for a fusion reactor based on the compression of a magnetically-confined plasma by a rotationally-stabilized liquid lithium liner, imploded non-destructively by pressure helium. The energy of the fusion alpha-particles is recovered in the expansion and compensates for the resistive losses in the liner, making the compression-expansion cycle self-sustaining. The liner acts as the confining magnet, the tritium breeding blanket, and the heat transfer medium, as well as serving as a continuously replaceable `first wall'. The result is a fusion reactor whose engineering power density is potentially, ~3 times greater than that of a tokamak.},

There is no first wall problem, since the wall is continuously regenerated at each cycle, and, since the liner acts as the blanket, the activation of the stationary part of the structure is minimised. In contrast to compression with stationary coils, liner compression of plasma allows the efficient use of very high compression ratios. Finally, the possibility of achieving reversible compression-expansion cycles with an efficient electromechanical system makes possible reactor designs with Q not much greater than 1, which could lead to very compact fusion systems.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. When a sufficiently strong shock emerges from the free surface of a solid, micron-sized particles may be âejectedâ from the tiny defects, grain boundaries or surface inclusions characteristic of real surfaces. If the solid surface bounds a gas or plasma such as an MTF or ICF target, the introduction of surface (perhaps high-Z) material into the gas or plasma may significantly alter its properties and behavior. The formation of ejecta particles has been the subject of both experimental measurements and computational modeling. Simple hydrodynamic drag models have been less than completely adequate, and recent work has explored hydrodynamic (such as Richtmyer-Meshkov) explanations. Less experimental work has been devoted to exploring ejecta particle transport in gas (or plasmas), and most of that work has been done in planar geometries. A new high precision, experiment, called the Damaged Surface Hydrodynamics Experiment, has been developed to explore transport of ejecta particles into gas (or plasma) in converging geometries, diagnosed by high resolution, fast, multi-frame imaging by proton radiography to inform the continuing development of transport models and validate current and future simulations.To provide a high precision, predictable, reproducible, and controllable drive, a pulse-power driven, dynamic, cylindrical, liner-on-target configuration has been developed that is compatible with the Los Alamos proton radiography facility. To further control the initial conditions, preformed, carefully characterized, micron-sized (tungsten) particles were used in place of shock-formed particulate. Initial experiments explored the shock-launched transport of ~1 micron particles from the converging surface into vacuum and into about 10 atmospheres of a low atomic weight (Ar) and higher atomic weight (Xe) gas. The experiment was driven by the PHELIX pulsed-power system utilizing a high-efficiency (k ~ 0.93) transformer to couple a small capacitor bank (U ~ 300 kJ) to a low inductance load in a Z-pinch configuration. The current pulse (Ipeak = 3.7 MAmp, ÎÎ¹~10 ÎŒs) was measured via a fiber optic Faraday rotation diagnostic. The experimental load consisted of a cylindrical Al liner (6 cm diam, 3 cm tall, 0.8 mm thick) and a cylindrical Al target (3 cm diam, 3 cm tall, 0.1 mm thick). The target was coated with a thin (0.1 mm) uniform layer of tungsten powder. The shock-launched powder layer fully detaches from the target and transports as a spatially correlated, radially converging (vr ~ 800 m/s) ring. The powder distribution is highly modulated in azimuth during transport in both the vacuum and gas-filled cases suggesting that radial motion modified by simple drag models are inadequate to describe the transport. Results are compared to 1D and 2D MHD simulations.},

  abstract  = {Dynamics of the compression of a magnetized plasma target by a heavy liner made of partially ionized high-Z material is discussed. A soft-landing (shockless) mode of the liner deceleration is analyzed. Conclusion is drawn that such mode is possible for the liners whose thickness at the time of the first contact with the target is smaller than ~10% of the initial (uncompressed) target radius. A combination of the plasma liner with one or two glide cones allows for direct access to the area near the center of the reactor chamber. One can then generate a plasma target inside the plasma liner at the optimum time. The other advantage of the glide cones is that they can be used to deliver additional fuel to the center of the target near the point of maximum compression and thereby increase the fusion yield.},

In all cases the compression cycle is initiated by closure of an electrical switch on the stator and ended by opening the same switch at a current zero. Liner fusion pressured can be achieved in self-driven captive liner systems. Total ohmic dissipation is rather large, however.},

  abstract  = {A method is described for choosing experimental parameters in studies of high-energy-density (HED) physics relevant to fusion energy, as well as other applications. An important HED issue for magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) is the interaction of metal pusher materials with megagauss (MG) magnetic fields during liner compression of magnetic flux and fusion fuel. The experimental approach described here is to study a stationary conductor when a pulsed current generates MG fields at the surface, instead of studying the inner surface of a moving liner. This places less demand upon the pulsed power system, and significantly improves diagnostic access. Thus the deceptively simple geometry chosen for this work is that of a z pinch composed of a metal cylinder carrying large current. Consideration of well known stability issues for the z pinch shows that for given peak current and rise time from a particular power supply, there is a minimum radius and thus maximum B field that can be created without disruption of the conductor before peak current. The reasons are reviewed why MG levels of magnetic field, as required for MIF, result in high temperatures and plasma formation at the surface of the metal in response to Ohmic heating. The distinction is noted between the liner regime obtained with cylindrical rods, which have a skin depth small compared to the conductor radius, and the exploding thin-wire regime, which has skin depth larger than the wire radius. A means of diagnostic development is described using a small facility (DPM15) built at the University of Nevada, Reno. It is argued that surface plasma temperature measurements in the 10-eV range are feasible based on the intensity of visible light emission.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given: To take advantage of the smaller scale, higher density regime of MIF an efficient method for achieving the compressional heating required to reach fusion gain conditions must be found. The method needs to be simple and capable of repetitive operation. The macroparticle (macron) formed liner compression of the Field Reversed Configuration is such a method. The approach to be described here employs an assemblage of small macro-particles (macrons) to form a more massive liner that radially compresses and heats the FRC plasmoid to fusion conditions. With the momentum flux being delivered by an array low mass, but high velocity macrons, many of the difficulties encountered with the implosion power technology are eliminated, and uniquely addresses the major challenges facing magneto-inertial fusion. Namely: (1) It embodies a compression scheme that can very efficiently and repetitively generate the kinetic liner energy required to reach fusion gain; (2) it provides for both the target plasma and liner energy to be generated remote from the reactor vessel. This is critical as the reactor environment is likely to be incompatible with the specialized pulse power equipment employed in conventional liner approaches; and (3) the timescale for forming and accelerating both the FRC and liner can be much longer than the time that the energy is thermalized in the implosion. This avoids the need for the very high voltages required to produce multi-megampere compression currents. In fact the switching requirement for the macron formed liner (MFL) is well within the range of currently available solid state devices. The timescale for testing and development as a fusion device can be rapidly accelerated by taking advantage of new research results at MSNW where the FRC plasmoid accelerator experiment has already demonstrated the dynamic formation of a FRC suitable for the target plasma for the macron liner fusion reactor.},

  abstract  = {For several decades, the notion of compression of plasma to fusion conditions by liner implosion has been pursued by several groups. This quest has often achieved success with some form of liner implosion technology, but not in the actual compression of plasma. Several plasma targets have been proposed, ranging from plasma magnetized to reduce heat transfer, but mechanically-supported by the liner, to plasmas confined and supported by magnetic field, in some configuration of open and closed field-lines. In all cases, the principal issue remains one of preventing the high atomic-number material of the liner from penetrating the plasma and countering the gain in plasma temperature sought by compression. Two factors foster development of such deleterious penetration: the creation of a liquid/vapor layer at the liner surface at high magnetic fields, and disruption of this layer by Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the final stages of plasma compression. The latter factor, of course, depends on the desired efficiency of energy transfer from liner kinetic energy to the plasma. In reactor concepts, the efficiency needs to be high in order to reduce the total system energy and size to attractive values. Within a general review of issues of liner compression of plasma, we discuss reactor cost optimization by use of plasma at pressures intermediate between the values of conventional magnetically- or inertially-confined fusion concepts. We also describe the development of an equilibrium layer of vapor adjacent to the liner surface at high magnetic fields, and the consequences of liner deceleration and rebound for reactor concepts and research progress.},

Much of this activity operates with technology developed for other applications (e.g., soft X-ray generation), which can be significantly larger than actually required for the scientific objectives of such experiments. This is particularly true if imaging diagnostics (e.g., proton radiography) with greater spatial and temporal resolution become available, permitting implosion experiments of smaller scale size. This paper develops scaling relationships for liner implosions driven capacitively (direct or transformer coupled) or by magnetic-flux compression generators and indicates a substantial reduction in system energy with reduced scale size.

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. Back in 1970, the two principal sources of prompt X-radiation were high-voltage bremsstrahlung machines and the dense plasma focus. The former, operating at diode voltages above about a megavolt, provided X-ray spectra that were adequate above many tens of kilovolts, (and better at even higher energies). The latter device offered much softer spectra, but poor efficiencies for conversion of stored energy to X-ray output. In both cases, efficiencies were at much less than a few percent. We needed to do better, which required a new approach.The Shiva program, which began officially in February 1971, after initial calculations in December 1970, was based on the concept originally called the Electromagnetic Implosion Xray Source1. This concept is basically a large-radius z-pinch implosion of high-Z material. It derives from work that was directed toward electric propulsion for spacecraft2. The concept comprises the initiation of a multi-megampere, axial discharge through a thin cylindrical, metallic foil or wirearray, which quickly becomes a plasma; followed by the implosion of this high-Z plasma liner due to the radial Lorentz force, accumulating kinetic energy at speeds above 200 km/s; and then converting this energy, obtained over a few microseconds or less, into thermal energy and soft Xradiation in several nanoseconds. Operation is based on recognition that the dynamic z-pinch can absorb energy from the power source efficiently (>25%) by means of the timerate-of-change of inductance due to implosion. Successful behavior, however, required conquering the problem of heat transfer from the very high current discharge to the vacuuminsulator surface, especially the copious amounts of UV. At the time, c. 1971, the only sources of the necessary multimegampere currents were capacitor banks comprising many units connected in parallel at very low inductance, and explosively-driven, magnetic-flux compression generators.

The basic problem is the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in liquid surfaces during acceleration and deceleration (Rayleigh-Taylor instability). This situation can be avoided if the liner material is accelerated without a free outer surface, and if it possesses sufficient angular momentum so that the centrifugal acceleration of the inside surface exceeds its radial deceleration at turn-around. Experiments with rotating liquid sodium-potassium liners imploded electro-magnetically have demonstrated the latter stabilization technique; while a gas-driven, free-piston device using water liners has been used to study the former method.},

  abstract  = {The Naval Research Laboratory has been investigating the use of imploding liner magnetic flux compression techniques to achieve high energy densities. Of particular interest has been the possibility of utilizing liner implosions to compress plasma adiabatically to thermonuclear fusion temperatures. Initial concepts followed the work at IAE Kurchatov and involved the electromagnetic implosion of copper and aluminum cylinders in the manner of a theta pinch. To avoid irreversible solid-mechanical behavior (buckling shrapnel, etc.) experiments were later performed with rotationally stabilized, liquid sodium-potassium liners, again imploded electromagnetically. To stabilize the liquid liner motion completely, a new implosion technique, utilizing free pistons driven by high pressure gas, has been developed. Stabilized-liner implosion systems have been constructed at NRL which allow a matrix of hydrodynamic and high magnetic field phenomena to be investigated. Smaller devices (`water models') are used to study basic dynamical behavior of incompressible fluid liners. Two other devices, LINUS-O and HELIUS, with the initial bores of 30 cm and 15 cm, respectively, can be used to study compressible liner dynamics and magnetic diffusion.},

  abstract  = {The notion of employing very high magnetic fields for fusion has been extended to so-called magnetized-target fusion (MTF), which may comprise both magnetic and inertial-confinement fusion schemes, and magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) in which the inertia of the liner is explicitly recognized for compressing and holding fusion plasma at relatively high density. Recently, the U.S. Department of Energy through ARPA-E has initiated the ALPHA program for technologies that will enable the development of low-cost controlled fusion by MIF. While it is certainly possible to continue the past history of single-shot implosions of liners onto plasma targets, it has become clear that some means for performing frequent laboratory experiments at multimegajoule levels are needed for reasonable progress. To develop the necessary plasma targets for liner compression requires hundreds of shots, so technology for low cost, repetitive experiments must be created and demonstrated. Furthermore, to satisfy overall program goals, these techniques must extend to break-even experiments and economical fusion power reactors. The stabilized liner compressor (SLC) seeks to accomplish these goals by means of pneumatically driven, annular free-pistons imploding rotationally stabilized liquid metal liners. We review the basic concept, including the reactor embodiment, and discuss the liner and plasma issues for SLC.},

It depends, however, on magnetic fields at megagauss levels. These field levels require dynamic conductors, e.g., imploding shells, aka, liners. Two broad approaches follow from the communities attracted to MIF, respectively: an ICF-related side at higher energy-density interested in ignition, enabled in part by high magnetic fields, and an MCF-side, typically interested in arrangements that represent extensions of MCF to much higher fields than conventional programs. The latter harkens to back to US and Soviet programs of the 1970's1,2 and looks for efficiency, rather than ignition.},

The basic interactions include ionization of materials such as injected gas or preinstalled wires/foils, acceleration of these materials by the Lorentz force, and expulsion of the resulting plasma flows. We review the use of a particular arrangement in the form of a plasma flow switch that acts as a multimegampere commutator, but it can also provide a magnetized-plasma target for compression by an imploding liner. In a quite separate concept, a plurality of quasi-steady plasma guns in a spherical array provides converging, collimated jets to compress plasma with stand-off from the plasma generators and chamber walls. Such stand-off in a repetitively pulsed system can be crucial for the development of fusion power reactors at megagauss energy densities.},

We consider the use of an ultrahigh speed plasma flow from a special coaxial-gun arrangement known as the plasma flow switch. Experiments have demonstrated that this arrangement can provide plasma flows with speeds in excess of 2000 km/s. Stagnation of such a plasma flow results in fully stripped aluminum plasma with electron temperatures of 30 keV. Substitution of deuterium or a deuterium-tritium mixture could provide target plasma at kilovolt temperatures within an imploding liner. Such temperatures suggest that, even if substantial heat loss occurred during liner compression, fusion-level temperatures would be possible. The concatenation of events to generate the ultrahigh speed flow, to direct it into the implosion chamber, and to arrange liner dynamics for effective compression demands numerical simulation, which is based on initial analytical estimates. Both types of calculation for exploring this concept are discussed.},

This layout is appropriate for a low-inductance, low-cost, 60-kV capacitor bank operated in an air environment. The control and monitoring system allows for a shot-to-shot time of less than 30 min., with emphasis on remote control and safety.},

New features implemented for the scrape-off layer (SOL) and the MHD thermal transport in the confinement region are described. TOKES is now able to carry out self-consisted simulations with edge localized modes (ELMs) and with a tungsten wall. The impact of SOL plasma on the vessel surface is calculated based on random tests for gyrating particles with the trajectories calculated in the guiding centre approximation. A simple SOL model for the atoms, emitted due to sputtering and then ionized, is applied to account for the recycling and impurity densities at the separatrix. Benchmark results demonstrate the abilities of the code being under development. Plasma contamination in its dependence on the materials (C or W) for outer and inner divertor legs is examined. The operation deterioration caused by vaporization at tungsten divertor surfaces after ELMs is addressed.[All rights reserved Elsevier].},

In comparison between the calculation and a C-W twin test limiter experiment in TEXTOR-94, C release from the C side of the limiter is dominated by reflection of C impurity from the W deposits, in addition to physical sputtering of C; chemical erosion is strongly suppressed, due to the dynamic effect which makes C-W mixed layer, C deposition on W gradually changes the reflection coefficient and sputter yields. Formation of a sharp boundary between erosion and C deposition zones on the W side of the limiter is well reproduced by simulation. Local redeposition patterns of C and W on the limiter surface are also calculated},

Because of the large plasma current and the need of highly shaped plasmas, the poloidal field (PF) coils should be located inside the toroidal field in order to reduce their current. Even then, the divertor coils carry large currents. The ARIES-ST PF coils are superconducting using the internally cooled cable-in-conduit conductor. The peak self field in the divertor coils is about 15 T and the highest field in the non-divertor coils is about 6 T. The PF magnets have built-in margins that are sufficient to survive disruptions without quenching. The costing study indicates that the specific cost of the PF system is \$80/kg. Detailed design and trade-off studies of ARIES-ST are presented and remaining R&amp;D issues are identified},

  abstract  = {Magnetic measurements alone on spherical tori should allow a very
	good separation of the poloidal beta $beta_{p}$, from the internal
	self-inductance $l_{i}$/2 and should even permit an accurate estimate
	of the current density $j_{phi}$ profile. However, the reduced space
	allowed for magnetic sensors near the central conductor in a spherical
	tokamak, and the possibility of producing flux core spheromak configurations
	without a central conductor, could imply that magnetic probes are
	not present in the cavity of the spherical torus. The fluxes and
	fields of a variety of calculated spherical torus configurations,
	all endowed with a single or double null separatrix, are analysed
	in terms of spherical multipolar moments obtained from simulated
	magnetic measurements located only upon a sphere surrounding the
	spherical plasma. The solution to the problem of the absence of magnetic
	measurements in the cavity of the spherical torus is to fix from
	non-magnetic measurements (e.g., spectroscopy) the plasma inboard
	boundary $r_{in}$ on the equatorial plane. This constraint is added
	to the constraints of matching the spherical multipolar expansion
	in an iterative solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation, on the basis
	of a spherical geometry. The convergence of the spherical reconstructive
	equilibrium code is extremely fast and gives an error on the total
	plasma current $I_{p}$ of less than 1\% at an aspect ratio A=1.2,
	an error on the position of the plasma boundary of less than 2\%
	of the radius of the plasma sphere, an error on $\beta_{p}$ of at
	most 15\% and, finally, the $j_{phi}$ profile is extremely well reconstructed
	in peaked, flat and even hollow cases. The effect of an uncertainty
	$\pm$ delta $r_{in}$ upon the spectroscopic identification of the
	plasma inboard boundary on the equatorial plane $r_{in}$ is assessed},

	For this reason the chamber has a high electrical resistance for

	resistance of the new chamber and the considerably larger margin
	of mechanical strength, discharges can be obtained in a toroidal
	magnetic field of up to 2 T at plasma currents of up to 220 kA. The

	significantly. The number of different sensors was increased, and,
	in addition to the conventional Rogowski loops, Mirnov probes, diamagnetic
	loops, and horizontal and vertical flux sensors, the electromagnetic

	surface and gradient sensors. A distinctive design feature is that

	This paper describes the diagnostics and measurements on plasmas
	which, for CTX-produced plasmas, are the hottest and longest-lived
	discharges using a solid copper flux conserver. These spheromaks
	are formed using a static hydrogen background gas filling the entire
	vacuum system before the discharge. The density rapidly decays in
	150-300 &mu;s from an initial value of (1-3)&times;10<sup>14</sup>
	cm<sup>-3</sup> to a steady-state plateau with a value of (1-4)&times;10<sup>13</sup>
	cm<sup>-3</sup>, determined by the pressure of the gas fill. A multi-point
	Thomson scattering system measures the radial profiles of electron
	temperature and density. Peak temperatures of over 40 eV are observed,
	and the average temperature increases in time by Ohmic heating from
	15 eV to over 30 eV. Equilibrium models for the magnetic field structure
	are used to calculate values of peak local beta (8-13\%), volume-averaged
	beta (3-8\%), and engineering beta (10-25\%). The operation with
	a filling gas results in a reduction of the impurity radiation power
	as measured by spectroscopy. Improved vacuum practices, discharge
	cleaning and the use of the static gas fill have resulted in discharges
	in which the radiation power loss is not dominating the energy balance
	late in time. Particle loss and the associated ionization and heating
	of the neutral particles required to maintain the density plateau
	appear to be the major energy loss processes in the spheromak},

  abstract  = {Electrostatic (DC) helicity injection has previously been shown to
	successfully sustain the magnetic fields of spheromaks and tokamaks.
	The magnitude of the injected magnetic helicity balances (within
	experimental error) the flux lost by resistive decay of the toroidal
	equilibrium. Hence the problem of optimizing this current drive scheme
	involves maximizing the injected helicity (the voltage-connecting-flux
	product) while minimizing the current (which multiplied by the voltage
	represents the energy input and also possible damage to the electrodes).
	The impedance (voltage-to-current ratio) and energy efficiency of
	a DC helicity injection experiment are studied on the CTX spheromak
	[Phys. Fluids 29, 3415 (1986)]. Over several years changes were made
	in the physical geometry of the coaxial magnetized plasma source
	as well as changes in the external electrical circuit. The source
	could be operated over a wide range of external charging voltage
	(and hence current), applied axial flux, and source gas flow rate.
	A database of resulting voltage, helicity injection, efficiency,
	electron density, and rotation has been created. These experimental
	results are compared to an ideal magnetohydrodynamic theory of magnetic
	flux flow. The theory is parametrized by the dimensionless Hall parameter,
	the ratio of electric to mass current. For a constant Hall parameter
	the theory explains why the voltage depends quadratically on the
	current at constant flux. The theory also explains the approximately
	linear dependence of the impedance-to-current ratio on the current-to-flux
	ratio of the source. The current-to-flux ratio itself (the energy-per-unit
	helicity of the source) is bounded below by considerations of force
	balance. While the rotation of the flow is not understood, the density
	of the sustained spheromak is shown to be related to the mass flow
	in the source, supporting the constant Hall parameter assumption.
	The overall efficiency of sustainment through DC helicity injection
	is limited by the usual Ohmic resistive decay, by the force-balance
	limits on the current-to-flux ratio, by the losses of the external
	electrical circuit, and by the fundamental limitations of the achievable
	impedance of flux flow in a magnetized plasma. Even so, ratios of
	spheromak magnetic energy to capacitor bank energy of over 17\% have
	been achieved on CTX. Ignoring external circuit losses the efficiency
	of electrostatic helicity injection for converting energy received
	by the coaxial source to the energy of the spheromak magnetic field
	has exceeded 70\%},

	Experiments are carried out using the TOR and BN facilities with

	diamagnetic loops, radially inserted magnetic probes, neutron and
	X-ray detectors and an He-Ne laser interferometer (&int;nd<i>l</i>).
	It is established that power losses of magnetic flux and energy develop
	under conditions of spontaneous shaping of the closed structure or
	when the control elements are partially utilized. A marked improvement
	in all the characteristics of the compact torus is observed when
	programmed operation of the control elements if optimized. An appreciable
	increase in energy inside the separatrix is observed when the start
	of the longitudinal wave is delayed; the evolution of the geometrical
	dimensions and parameters of the plasma during compression satisfactorily
	agrees with two-dimensional MHD calculations assuming zero losses.
	When the external field is reduced, an increase in the radius and
	length of the compact torus is observed, which to within measurement
	error obeys the adiabatic law. An ion temperature of T&ap;1.4 keV
	is achieved, and the collisionless nature of the heating (&lambda;<sub>ii</sub>/L&ap;50)
	is confirmed. It is established that an unfavorable torus structure
	which initiates losses may be self-sustaining},

	to solar prominence loops; both are quasi-static, force-free, low
	&beta;, MHD dominated plasma configurations where magnetic helicity
	conservation and Woltjer-Taylor relaxation play important roles.
	An essential feature of prominence eruptive behavior is that the
	prominence remains stable and line-tied to the solar surface for
	a very long time (hours or days) and then suddenly erupts in less
	than an hour. Spheromak formation involves a similar abrupt transition
	from a long-lived stable line-tied state to a detached state. In
	fact, the established criterion for spheromak formation is essentially
	identical to the analysis of Vrsnak et al. (1991) concerning the
	relationship between magnetic field twist and the stability of observed
	prominence loops. In both spheromaks and Vrsnak et al.'s analysis,
	the sudden bifurcation from a stable attached state to an eruptive
	detached state occurs when the pitch angle of the magnetic field
	exceeds approximately 45&deg;. Furthermore, the sudden topological
	transformation conserves helicity: Barnes et al. (1986) demonstrated
	that magnetic helicity is conserved during spheromak formation, while
	Rust (1994) found that magnetic helicity is conserved during prominence
	eruption},

	of solar prominence eruptions. It is found that the initial simulated
	prominences are arched, but then bifurcate into twisted secondary
	structures which appear to follow fringing field lines. A simple
	model explains many of these topological features in terms of the
	trajectories of field lines associated with relaxed states, i.e.,
	states satisfying &nabla;&times;<b>B</b>=&lambda;<b>B.</b> This model
	indicates that the field line concept is more fundamental than the
	flux tube concept because a field line can always be defined by specifying
	a starting point whereas attempting to define a flux tube by specifying
	a starting cross section typically works only if &lambda; is small.
	The model also shows that, at least for plasma evolving through a
	sequence of force-free states, the oft-used line-tying concept is
	in error. Contrary to the predictions of line-tying, direct integration
	of field line trajectories shows explicitly that when &lambda; is
	varied, both ends of field lines intersecting a flux-conserving plane
	do <i>not</i> remain anchored to fixed points in that plane. Finally,
	a simple explanation is provided for the S-shaped magnetic structures
	often seen on the sun; the S shape is shown to be an automatic consequence
	of field line arching and the parallelism between magnetic field
	and current density for force-free states},

  abstract = {The Tokamak `Tuman-3' is designed for plasma compression experiments
	in a time-rising toroidal magnetic field. The Tokamak features are
	large aspect ratio (R/a=2.3), nearness of the iron core to the plasma
	region and low time constant of the vacuum chamber (0.15 ms). Feedback
	plasma position control improves essentially discharge repetition,
	makes easier to obtain operation conditions, allows to vary gas injection
	without breaking the equilibrium. The combined gas-discharge chamber
	cleaning, equilibrium control and programmed pulsed gas injection
	result in MHD-stable discharges with low safety factor (up to 2.2).
	The vertical plasma shift does not exceed 0.5 cm at the plasma current
	front and 0.2 cm at the stationary discharge stage. The horizontal
	plasma shift is within 0.2-0.5 cm. Further development of the control
	system includes the plasma current control system, density control
	and that of current profile and MHD-column activity level. Some experiments
	are conducted in `Tuman-3' to study the effect of chamber cleaning,
	gas injection, additional heating etc. on discharge repetition and

  abstract  = {The toroidal current driven by relaxation processes in a cylindrical
	spherical tokamak (ST) geometry with coaxial injected flux is estimated
	by use of the linear ideal stability boundary of equilibria with
	a high current on the open driven flux and a lower current on the
	closed flux. Instabilities with toroidal mode number n = 1 have been
	shown to play a vital role in the helicity injection current drive,
	being closely associated with the relaxation process which distributes
	current from a directly driven open flux to a closed flux. Previous
	results for spheromaks (1D and 2D equilibria) and STs (1D equilibria)
	have predicted stabilization, for a given open flux current, if the
	closed flux plasma current is sufficiently large, suggesting that
	the current drive mechanism is self-limiting. New results presented
	here for 2D ST equilibria are consistent with the 1D results, but
	new features appear in the stability maps as the axial length and
	toroidal field (TF) strength are varied in the equilibria. These
	include changes in the shape of stability boundaries and the estimated
	driven current, changes in the mode structure due to equilibrium
	changes and resonance effects which extend stability boundaries into
	the stable region. As the minimum and maximum of the safety factor
	q profile cross integer rational values, the resonant mode is destabilized,

	on the open flux which plays a key role in helicity-injected current
	drive. The stability of spheromak equilibria with both open and closed
	flux and realistic current profiles representative of helicity-injected
	state is investigated, where a kink instability in the open flux
	is shown to dominate a tilt mode in the closed flux as the open flux
	current density is increased. A previous one-dimensional model is
	extended to more realistic two-dimensional equilibria which properly
	incorporate a region of closed magnetic flux as well as open flux
	penetrating the boundaries at electrodes. A new stability code SCOTS
	has been developed and benchmarked which can determine the growth
	rates of ideal MHD modes in this geometry. The coordinate system
	for this code has been developed such that it extends smoothly across
	the separatrix between closed and open flux, thus not imposing any
	unphysical discontinuities in mode structures. From the results,
	the operating conditions of devices can be predicted since helicity-injection
	current drive requires fluctuations which arise from the saturated
	current driven instability in the open flux, and since these systems
	operate near the stability boundary for this mode},

	and space plasmas. First, recent high-resolution velocity measurements
	of impurity ions using ion Doppler spectroscopy (IDS) show bi-directional
	outflow jets at 40 km/s (nearly the Alfven speed). The SSX IDS instrument
	measures with 1 &mu;s or better time resolution the width and Doppler
	shift of the CIII impurity (H plasma) 229.7 nm line to determine
	the temperature and line-averaged flow velocity during spheromak
	merging events. High flow speeds are corroborated using an in situ
	Mach probe. Second, ion heating to nearly 10<sup>6</sup> K is observed
	after reconnection events in a low-density kinetic regime. Transient
	electron heating is inferred from bursts on a 4-channel soft x-ray
	array as well as vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Third, the out-of-plane
	magnetic field and the in-plane Lorentz force in a reconnection volume
	both show a quadrupolar structure at the ion inertial scale (c/&omega;<sub>pi</sub>).
	Time resolved vector magnetic field measurements on a 3D lattice
	B(r, t)) enables this measurement. Earlier work at SSX has shown
	that formation of three-dimensional structure at the ion inertial
	scale is temporally and spatially correlated with the observation
	of superthermal, super-Alfvenic ions accelerated along the X-line
	normal to the local 2D plane of reconnection. Each of these measurements
	will be related to and compared with similar observations in a solar

	into the empty vacuum vessel of the Caltech ENCORE tokamak (i.e.,
	without tokamak plasma) [Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>64</b>, 2144 (1990);
	Phys. Fluids B <b>2</b>, 1306 (1990)]. Magnetic probe arrays (in
	a number of configurations) have been used to make single shot, unaveraged,
	in situ measurements of the spheromak equilibrium. These measurements
	are important because (i) they reveal for the first time the equilibrium
	structure of spheromaks in a toroidal geometry, (ii) they provide
	a reliable estimate of magnetic helicity and energy of spheromak
	plasmas used in injection experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>64</b>,
	2144 (1990)], and (iii) they constitute the first measurements of
	spheromak motion across and interaction with static magnetic fields
	(which are useful in corroborating theories). Probe measurements
	in the tokamak DC toroidal field show for the first time that the
	spheromak exhibits a `double tilt.' The spheromak first tilts while
	in the cylindrical entrance region, emerging into the tokamak vessel
	antialigned to the DC toroidal field, then expands into the tokamak
	vacuum vessel, and finally tilts again to form an oblate (nonaxisymmetric,
	<i>m</i>=1) configuration. In addition, the spheromak drifts vertically
	in the direction given by <b>J</b><sub>center</sub>&times;<b>B</b><sub>tok</sub>,
	where <b>J</b><sub>center</sub> is the unbalanced poloidal current
	that threads the center of the spheromak torus. Probe arrays at different
	toroidal locations show that the spheromak shifts toroidally (horizontally
	left or right) in the direction opposite that of the static toroidal
	field. In the absence of toroidal flux, the <i>m</i>=1 object develops
	a helical pitch, the sense of the pitch depending on the sign of
	the spheromak helicity. The spheromak equilibrium in the toroidal
	vessel is well fit by a pressureless infinite cylindrical model;
	however, there is evidence of deviation from <i>m</i>=1 symmetry
	because of toroidal effects, nonuniform <i>J</i>/<i>B</i> profile,
	and finite &beta;. Experiments performed in a test facility consisting
	of the spheromak gun and a replica of the entrance region (with a
	closed end) show that the spheromak is generated with its axis coaxial
	with that of the gun. Coherent, <i>m</i>=2 magnetic modes are observed
	during the formation stage rotating in the <b>E</b>&times;<b>B</b>
	direction at about 125 kHz (rotation velocity corresponding to 40%

	The footpoint motions inject helicity as well as energy, and the

	motions at the ends, confined by a constant external pressure at
	the curved surface, which is a free boundary. The problem of the
	loop evolution in response to given footpoint motions is solved,
	and an interesting example of multiple equilibria arises. The heating

  abstract  = {The hope to find a path towards a fusion reactor of small size and
	(relatively) easy technical handling laid the background for the
	study of high-beta concepts in the past. While it became apparent
	that straightforward progress in the line of theta pinches was not
	achievable, many activities ceased to continue. One of the few exceptions
	is the investigation of field-reversed configurations (FRCs) which
	has persisted on a small scale over the years. With a series of experiments
	starting in the mid-seventies a breakthrough occurred when two major
	obstacles were overcome by Es'kov and coworkers (1978) in maintaining
	a reasonable fraction of the bias flux and by Minato and colleagues
	(1982) in controlling the rotational instability. Since then a very
	spectacular progress has been achieved leading to a multiplication
	in the lifetime, the demonstration of axial plasma translation, and
	a substantial improvement of both experimental knowledge and theoretical
	understanding in equilibrium and confinement physics of the FRC.
	The compact toroid is defined as a plasma with singly connected,
	toroidal magnetic topology which is sustained by internal plasma
	currents. No toroidal field coils link the plasma. Today, compact
	toroids are investigated predominantly within the framework of these
	two variants: the FRC with purely poloidal fields and the Spheromak
	which has poloidal and toroidal fields of similar magnitude. Both
	concepts are supported by related studies, e.g. on relativistic particle
	rings},

	The previous theoretically predicted diverging confinement time of
	a sharp-boundary plasma column as &beta;&rarr;1 is removed by properly
	taking into account the magnetic tension effect near the column throats.
	The obtained end loss rate is tested through simulation: the present

	When the magnetic field inside the column is reversed, the plasma
	end loss much improves: the end loss induces the reconnection of
	the field lines near the throats, which produces closed field lines
	(islands). Those islands are found to be unstable against the tilting
	instability. The tilting-induced reconnection of the island field
	line and the mirror-field line is a very fast process even for negligibly
	resistive plasmas and this helps to rapidly spill out the plasma
	confined in the islands. The significance of these processes for

  abstract = {The present report is devoted to investigation of plasma turbulence
	behaviour during a transition to the improved confinement triggered
	by RF power launching in the limiter discharges of the TUMAN-3M and
	the FT-2 tokamaks. The experiments have been carried out with using
	of the Doppler reflectometry based on backscattering with oblique
	incidence of probing microwave beam, for which in plasma there is
	a cutoff. The observation of the Doppler frequency shift of scattering
	spectra in such an experiment allows to estimate the plasma fluctuation
	poloidal velocity in tokamak. A specific transition to improved confinement
	initiated by RF pulse was revealed in the TUMAN-3M tokamak during
	ICR heating. The drastic narrowing of backscattering spectra associated
	with the transport suppression has been observed. The experiment
	in the FT-2 tokamak has been performed during the transition to H-mode
	triggered by the RF pulse of the lower-hybrid frequency region. The
	strong shear of plasma rotation observed via Doppler reflectometry
	strictly corresponded to appearance of the improved confinement.
	The common and specific features of turbulence suppression in the
	TUMAN-3M and FT-2 devices during L-H transitions triggered by the
	RF power launch are summarized and compared. The possible mechanisms
	of plasma rotation shear are discussed in conclusion},

	by analyzing backscattered radiation for different angles of incidence
	of the probing beam from the normal to the cut-off surface. The poloidal
	rotation velocity of the plasma fluctuations is determined from the
	Doppler shift of the reflected radiation spectrum measured on the
	edge of the tokamak during the transition to the H-mode. It is shown
	that, before the transition to the H-mode, the rotation velocity
	can be estimated quantitatively from the spectral shift or from the
	rate at which the phase of the reflected signal grows. The experimental
	data obtained during the transition to the H-mode provide evidence
	for the onset of a sheared poloidal flow. The shear makes it difficult
	to correctly estimate the poloidal rotation velocity in the improved
	confinement regime. The main mechanisms responsible for the broadening
	of the backscattered radiation spectra are considered. The turbulent
	diffusion coefficients determined under the assumption that the spectral
	broadening is diffusive in character are found to be close to those
	determined from the charged-particle balance},

  abstract  = {The magnetic properties of the spheromak configuration produced by
	a combination of slow theta and <i>Z</i> discharges in the University
	of Maryland Spheromak experiment (MS) are reported. The magnetic
	structure of the plasma in MS has been mapped out by arrays of passive
	magnetic pickup coils. The Taylor relaxation process is observed
	during the formation phase. The magnetic profile evolves in such
	a way that the ratio of poloidal current <i>I</i><sub>p</sub> to
	poloidal flux &psi; in the plasma approaches a constant value, where
	&mu;<sub>0</sub><i>I</i><sub>p</sub>=<i>k</i><sub>el</sub>&psi;.
	When the spheromak is formed, the magnetic field configuration is
	close to Taylor's minimum energy state, &mu;<sub>0</sub><i>j</i>=<i>kB</i>.
	This constant <i>k</i> is related to the size of the spheromak produced.
	A spheromak with 1.0 T maximum field, corresponding to 650 kA poloidal
	current, has been produced in MS. However, due to the high plasma
	density (6-8&times;10<sup>20</sup> m<sup>-3</sup>) and the presence
	of low-<i>Z</i> impurities (mainly carbon and oxygen), the plasma
	is radiation dominated with electron temperature &les;15 eV. The
	magnetic field decays exponentially during the decay phase. Axisymmetric
	equilibrium states that could exist in the configuration are calculated
	with a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium code. Comparison of the numerical
	calculation with the experimental measurements indicates that the
	magnetic-field structure stays close to the equilibrium state as
	the plasma decays},

	Numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations are used to model the

	is deduced the electron density profile. Similar methods are used

  abstract  = {Scaling laws for plasma energy confinement must be invariant under
	any transformation which leaves the basic plasma equations themselves
	invariant. Hence, constraints can be placed on the scaling laws even
	though the calculation of energy loss may be intractable. These constraints
	are derived for several plasma models and shown to be characteristic
	of the model. Hence, in addition to reducing the number of parameters
	which have to be obtained empirically, these results could delineate
	which plasma models are appropriate for the calculation of losses.
	They show that the empirical scaling laws at present proposed for
	Tokamaks are incompatible with many conventional plasma models},

	(FRC) formation and stability by counter-helicity spheromak merging.
	A pair of midplane coils magnetically restricts the merging process
	to determine how the stability of the resulting magnetic configuration
	depends upon the quantity of toroidal flux remaining from the initial
	spheromaks. The diagnostic set at SSX, featuring the capability of
	measuring up to 600 magnetic field components at 800 ns time resolution,
	permits detailed studies of the dynamic three-dimensional magnetic
	structures produced during these experiments. A compact array of
	magnetic probes examines the local reconnection process, while a
	distributed array of probes examines global magnetic structure. Counter-helicity
	merging produces a FRC that persists for several Alfv&eacute;n times,
	although the oppositely directed toroidal field of the initial spheromaks
	does not completely annihilate. The m=1 (toroidal) mode dominates

	that many physical processes (turbulent fluctuations, core transport,
	edge transport, MHD equilibrium, various sources, etc.) be modeled
	and consistently coupled together. These processes vary in length-
	and time-scale, and in dimensionality. We are developing algorithms
	for coupling such processes in a manner that allows each to be advanced
	on the relevant time-scale. In particular, the goal is to advance
	the transport equations with a time-step on the order of the energy
	confinement time. Our methods are being tested by developing a prototype
	simulation code, CORSICA. This code is being constructed by taking
	existing codes and coupling them together as modules in a single
	code. The three main focuses of the project are: (1) coupling a 1-D
	core transport code to an axisymmetric free-boundary MHD equilibrium
	code (LLNL's TEQ) and to circuit equations for the poloidal field
	coils and passive structure (the resulting 1-1/2 D transport code
	is known as CORSICA 1.0); (2) coupling the core transport code to
	a 2-D edge transport code (UEDGE); and (3) coupling the transport
	codes to turbulence simulation codes. Progress in all three of these
	areas will be discussed, including: early results from CORSICA 1.0;
	an algorithm for coupling turbulence simulation fluxes into a transport
	code; results from coupling local and nonlocal Hasegawa-Wakatani
	turbulence simulation codes to a 1-D slab transport code, including
	discussion of local versus nonlocal transport; and time-dependent

	the reliability of these results. A line ratio measure is also made
	and compares well with the ionization balance. The electron power
	balance in these discharges is estimated assuming that only Spitzer
	dissipation (a small fraction of the total source power) heats the
	electrons. Titanium gettering is used to reduce recycling, and thus
	to measure the fraction of impurity due to recycling relative to
	that directly injected from the Marshall gun. It is established that
	during sustainment the electrons are radiation dominated everywhere,
	so that the rise in T<sub>e</sub> when Ti is used is quite moderate,
	from 30 to 50 eV. However, the impurity transport rate is substantially
	reduced by gettering, implying that high transport rates are not
	intrinsic to the spheromak configuration. Some more qualitative data
	pertaining to the decaying spheromak is also presented},

  abstract  = {Field-reversed configuration (FRC), characterized by its insignificant
	toroidal magnetic field compared to its confining poloidal magnetic
	field, has advantages in application to a fusion reactor for its
	engineering simplifications and high value of plasma beta. A novel
	method of slow formation of FRC can be achieved by the merging of
	two spheromaks with opposite toroidal fluxes, which may be termed
	as counterhelicity merging. A numerical simulation of the merging
	of two spheromaks with parallel toroidal fields (i.e. cohelicity
	merging) was first shown by Sato et al. Their results confirmed that
	the post merging toroidal flux becomes the sum of the pre-merging
	toroidal fluxes, while the poloidal flux remains larger of the pre-merging
	ones. We present a numerical simulation of the slow formation of
	FRC by the merging of two spheromaks with opposite toroidal fluxes.
	A rather important feature of such a method of formation of FRC should
	be made explicit. A spheromak is basically a Taylor minimum energy
	state. On the other hand the FRC with its single component poloidal
	magnetic field and high plasma &beta; is decidedly far away from
	a Taylor state. So a numerical simulation of this process, besides
	demonstrating the feasibility of such FRC formation, is expected
	to show the traits in the process of transition from a Taylor state
	to a non-Taylor state},

	growth and magnetized fuel advantages. They have the major advantage
	of economic scaling to high energy. Their principal technical risk
	is electrode plasmas. The financial risk for attempting demonstration
	of ignition is small compared to the established large tokomak and
	laser-driven approaches. The other pulsed power approach to fusion
	is fast Z-pinches. This approach attempts to overcome instability
	problems by employing short implosion times which means a small number

	compact toroids using a meter diameter, two-stage, puffed gas, magnetic

	that are studied are similar to spheromaks, but they are threaded
	by an inner conductor. This research effort, named MARAUDER (magnetically
	accelerated ring to achieve ultra-high directed energy and radiation),
	is not a magnetic confinement fusion program like most spheromak
	efforts. Rather, the ultimate goal of the present program is to compress
	toroids to high mass density and magnetic field intensity, and to
	accelerate the toroids to high speed. There are a variety of applications
	for compressed, accelerated toroids including fast opening switches,
	X-radiation production, radiofrequency (RF) compression, as well
	as charge-neutral ion beam and inertial confinement fusion studies.
	Experiments performed to date to form and accelerate toroids have
	been diagnosed with magnetic probe arrays, laser interferometry,
	time and space resolved optical spectroscopy, and fast photography.
	Parts of the experiment have been designed by, and experimental results
	are interpreted with, the help of two-dimensional (2-D), time-dependent
	magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations. When not drive by
	a second discharge, the toroids relax to a Woltjer-Taylor equilibrium
	state that compares favorably to the results of 2-D equilibrium calculations
	and to 2-D time-dependent MHD simulations. Current, voltage, and
	magnetic probe data from toroids that are driven by an acceleration
	discharge are compared to 2-D MHD and to circuit solver/slug model
	predictions. Results suggest that compact toroids are formed in 7-15
	&mu;sec, and can be accelerated intact with material species the

	Physics Experiment (SSPX) device at the Lawrence Livermore National
	Laboratory. This new understanding, together with a number of transmitter
	and receiver modifications suggested by this new understanding, has
	resulted in significant increases in both dynamic range and signal-to-noise
	ratios of the USPR signals. This in turn has translated to a significant
	reduction in receiver timing jitter and the number of "lost" signals
	in which the received power has dropped below the detection threshold
	USPR involves the propagation of short duration (~2-3 ns) chirps
	of moderate frequency bandwidth. These chirps axe upconverted to
	millimeter-wave frequencies, reflected from the plasma, and downconverted
	for detection and analysis. Each received chirp is analyzed at a
	number of simultaneous frequencies, with multiple chirps required
	to provide broad frequency coverage. Commercial time-to-amplitude
	converters convert the receiver time delays into easily acquired
	analog voltages with 25 ps resolution. On SSPX, four mixers (LO frequencies
	are 27, 44, 57 and 75 GHz) are utilized to up- and down-convert 7-16
	GHz chirped waveforms to millimeter-wave frequencies (34-91 GHz).
	Four mixer operation provides 32 frequency channels of timing data
	with 12 &mu;s resolution, while operation with only the lowest frequency
	mixer provides 8 frequency data with 3 &mu;s resolution. In addition
	to edge density profile information, the system is also capable of
	simultaneously monitoring density fluctuations on as many as 32 distinct
	density layers. Details of the upgraded USPR system axe described
	together with USPR profile and fluctuation data},

  abstract  = {Adiabatic compression of a preformed closed field line configuration
	by an imploding liner is considered. Three configurations are discussed:
	the field-reversed configuration, the spheromak, and the Z-pinch.
	It is shown that by employing a two-dimensional compression, one
	can reach a breakeven condition with an energy input into the plasma
	as low as 100 kJ. Typical initial dimensions of the liner are length,
	5 to 6 cm; radius, ~1 cm; and wall thickness, ~0.01 cm. Liner mass
	is in the range of a few grams. It is assumed that the initial plasma
	beta is of the order of unity; in this case, the final beta is much
	greater than 1, and the plasma is in a wall confinement regime. Typical
	plasma parameters for the final state (for the linear compression
	ratio equal to 10) are density 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>: temperature,
	10 keV; and magnetic field, 10<sup>7</sup> G. A brief discussion
	of various phenomena affecting the wall confinement is presented
	(magnetic field diffusion, radiative losses, and impurity penetration);
	the conclusion is drawn that the heat losses to the walls are modest
	and are not a factor that limits plasma enhancement Q. It is shown
	that at least for relatively thin liners, whose compressibility can
	be neglected, what limits Q is a relatively short liner dwell time
	near the maximum compression point. The scaling law for the Q versus
	the input parameters of the system is derived, which shows a relatively
	weak dependence of Q on the input energy. Possible ways for increasing
	the dwell time are discussed. Reactor potentialities of the system
	are briefly described. It is emphasized that the possibility of performing
	crucial experiments on small- to medium-scale experimental devices
	may considerably shorten the development path for the system under
	consideration. Some nonfusion applications of the system described
	are mentioned. Among them are burning and transmutation of long-lived
	fusion products, medical isotope production, a pulsed source of hard
	X rays, and fusion neutrons},

	The device is designed to produce a pre-compression plasma with a
	major radius of 17 cm, toroidal field of 20 kG, and current of 90
	kA. The compression leads to a plasma with major radius of 38 cm
	and minor radius of 10 cm. Scaling laws imply a density increase
	of a factor 6, temperature increase of a factor 3, and current increase
	of a factor 2.4. An additional feature of ATC is that it is a large
	tokamak which operates without a copper shell. Data which show that
	the expected MHD behavior is largely observed are presented and discussed},

	study NB injection in field reversed configurations (FRC) and spheromaks.
	The code calculates the ionization of the neutral particles and follows

	are determined by solving a Grad-Shafranov equation that includes
	the beam current. RMF current drive in FRCs was studied using a fully

	and collisions with electrons and neutrals. The electrons are described
	using Ohm's law with the Hall and pressure gradient terms. Ion spin
	up due to collisions with electrons reduces the current drive efficiency
	and a large fraction of neutrals is needed to keep the azimuthal
	ion velocity small. The principle of minimum rate of energy dissipation
	was employed to calculate relaxed states for a flux core spheromak

	(MHD) modes, particularly the tilt and shift; (ii) it has a poloidal
	divertor, and an amount of poloidal flux separating the closed flux
	surface region from the walls; and (iii) it might be sustained by
	helicity injection. Results are presented showing the dependence
	of the geometry on the distribution of bias flux on the conducting
	walls and showing the optimization of the 2-D formation scheme to
	minimize the contact of the plasma with coils, electrodes, and walls.
	This last topic involves taking advantage of current sheet formation
	and subsequent tearing, as in formation of the MS spheromak [Phys.
	Fluids <b>28</b>, 3154 (1985)]. The parameters which can be varied
	to produce this favorable formation scheme via tearing, rather than
	a formation that proceeds off the reversal coils, are explored. In
	addition, it is found that there is strong viscous heating of the
	ions in this early reconnection phase},

	using the generalized Balescu-Lenard extension of quasi-linear transport

	due to such turbulence tends to flatten the temperature profile,

	by the slope, &alpha;, of the linear &lambda;(&psi;) profile (where
	&lambda;=&mu;<sub>0</sub><b>J&ldr;B</b>/B<sup>2</sup> and &psi; is
	the poloidal flux). Very unstable configurations (with &alpha; well

	marginally unstable cases undergo only partial relaxation. Since
	we consider decaying plasmas without open flux (no driving), the
	partial relaxation process is a result of the dynamics of marginally
	unstable configurations. The effect of the Lundquist number, S, on
	a fixed initial condition (a fixed &alpha;) is studied. Increasing
	S leads to a higher level of fluctuations and poloidal flux amplification.
	However, it is found that, despite the stronger activity, the final
	level of relaxation is determined only by the initial slope &alpha;
	(for the high S regime considered here). The nonaxisymmetric activity
	produced by the instability is studied. The relaxation event begins
	with a dominant n=1 kink mode responsible for poloidal flux amplification
	and ends with a low activity period (of several tens of Alfve&acute;n
	times) which produces a current redistribution process that flattens
	the &lambda; profile. Finally, the MHD dynamo field is investigated.},

	with the applied toroidal field. Results are presented from a more
	detailed analysis of this scaling for a fixed gun current of 60 kA,
	utilizing direct internal measurements of current density and equilibrium

	of changes in the wavelength of the helical distortion of the open
	flux (identified with the global n=1 mode) connected to the helicity
	injector: the increase in toroidal current on closed flux surfaces
	is much more modest. We discuss changes in current profiles at differing

	in this regime. The crucial role of the boundary radial electric
	field was found in the experiments with internal bias probe. Other
	techniques were demonstrated to disturb the boundary plasma which
	led to H-mode triggering: short increase of working gas puffing,
	minor radius magnetic compression and pellet injection. The novel
	scaling of the energy confinement time in the Ohmic H-mode was obtained,
	which differs dramatically from the scaling for the ordinary Ohmic
	regime. There were found a strong dependence of &tau;<sub>E</sub>
	on plasma current and a weak dependence on density. The maximum value
	of &tau;<sub>E</sub> was 10 times longer than in the ordinary Ohmic
	region. The &tau;<sub>E</sub> scaling for the Ohmic H-mode is consistent

	by considering the PS and MS spheromak experiments at the University
	of Maryland in which helicity injection occurs due to voltages applied
	to a cylindrical array of Z discharge electrodes and fast rising
	poloidal fields. In addition it has been found that rotational fluid
	motion is present in these experiments which affects the helicity
	density. The author has measured the magnetic fields in the (r,z)
	plane and computed the magnetic helicity as a function of time for
	a variety of situations. In an effort to simplify the experiment
	the time varying poloidal fields are turned off and only the electrode
	voltages are used with an axial bias field},

	to the similarity of its field configuration to that of the spheromak.
	The Reversatron II RFP has been operated with N=0.5 (the usual configuration);
	with <i>N</i>=-0.5, which should increase the growth rates of the
	tilt and vertical shift; and with <i>N</i>=+1.35, which should increase
	the growth rate of the horizontal shift. Stability was investigated

	longer than the 4-&mu;s penetration time of the vertical field into

	for any of the three field indices. The only difference noted is
	that for <i>N</i>=+1.35, rigid vertical motion has, as expected,
	a lower fluctuation level than for <i>N</i>=+0.5. The data indicate

	plasma current and pressure, an independent limit on plasma density
	is observed in confined toroidal plasmas. This review attempts to
	summarize recent work on the phenomenology and physics of the density
	limit. Perhaps the most surprising result is that all of the toroidal
	confinement devices considered operate in similar ranges of (suitably
	normalized) densities. The empirical scalings derived independently
	for tokamaks and reversed-field pinches are essentially identical,
	while stellarators appear to operate at somewhat higher densities
	with a different scaling. Dedicated density limit experiments have
	not been carried out for spheromaks and field-reversed configurations,
	however, 'optimized' discharges in these devices are also well characterized
	by the same empirical law. In tokamaks, where the most extensive
	studies have been conducted, there is strong evidence linking the
	limit to physics near the plasma boundary: thus, it is possible to
	extend the operational range for line-averaged density by operating
	with peaked density profiles. Additional particles in the plasma
	core apparently have no effect on density limit physics. While there
	is no widely accepted, first principles model for the density limit,
	research in this area has focussed on mechanisms which lead to strong
	edge cooling. Theoretical work has concentrated on the consequences
	of increased impurity radiation which may dominate power balance
	at high densities and low temperatures. These theories are not entirely
	satisfactory as they require assumptions about edge transport and
	make predictions for power and impurity scaling that may not be consistent
	with experimental results. A separate thread of research looks for
	the cause in collisionality enhanced turbulent transport. While there
	is experimental and theoretical support for this approach, understanding
	of the underlying mechanisms is only at a rudimentary stage and no
	predictive capability is yet available},

	modelling and diagnostic developments is reported. The main devices
	presented belong to the class of Z-pinches, mostly plasma foci, and

	is important both for the main-stream fusion investigations as well

	compression by a factor of 2 in radius, field amplification by factors
	of 2-3 to 20 kG, and compressed densities exceeding 1016 cm<sup>-3</sup>.
	The results are in good agreement with two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
	simulations of the CT dynamics. The CT is formed between a pair of
	coaxial conical conductors that serve as both a flux conserver for
	stable, symmetric formation and as electrodes for the compression
	and acceleration phases. The CT is compressed by <i>J</i>&times;<i>B</i>
	forces (poloidal current, toroidal field) when a 120 kV, 260 kJ capacitor
	bank is discharged across the electrodes. The CT reaches two-fold
	compression to a radius of 8 cm and a length of 20-30 cm near the
	time of peak current, 10 &mu;sec (many Alfven times) after the accelerator
	fire time, and is subsequently accelerated in a 150 cm straight coaxial
	section to velocities in the range 1.5-6.5&times;10<sup>7</sup> cm/sec.
	A new set of acceleration/focusing electrodes 740 cm in length are
	projected to give an additional factor of 3 in radial compression
	with final velocities of 1-3&times;10<sup>8</sup> cm/sec (similar
	to previously achieved on RACE) and incident power densities of a
	few &times;10<sup>11</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Compact torus accelerators
	scaled to multimegajoules have the potential to achieve unprecedented
	plasma velocities and power densities with many applications in high-energy-density

  abstract = {Experimental results for a new type of collective accelerator based
	on magnetically confined compact torus (CT) plasma rings are described,
	and applications to both inertial and magnetic fusion are discussed.
	The principle of CT acceleration in the RACE device with an acceleration
	of 0.5 mg ring masses to 400 km/s and 0.02 mg ring masses to 1400
	km/s at &ges;30% efficiency has been demonstrated. About threefold
	ring focusing in radius has been observed. Scaling the CT accelerator
	to the multimegajoule level could provide an efficient, economical
	driver for inertial fusion (ICF) or magnetically insulated inertial
	fusion. Efficient conversion to X-rays for driving hohlraum-type
	ICF targets has been modeled by using a radiation-hydrodynamics code.
	At less demanding conditions than are required for ICF, a CT accelerator
	can be applied to fueling and current drive in tokamaks. Fueling
	is accomplished by injecting CTs at the required rate to sustain
	the particle inventory and at a velocity sufficient to penetrate
	to the magnetic axis before CT dissolution. Current drive is a consequence
	of the magnetic helicity content of the CT, which is approximately
	conserved during reconnection of the CT fields with the tokamak.
	Major areas of uncertainty in CT fueling and current drive concern
	the mechanism by which CTs will stop in a tokamak plasma and the
	effects of the CT on energy confinement and magnetic stability. Bounds
	on the required CT injection velocity are obtained by considering
	drag due to emission of an Alfven wave wake and rapid reconnection
	and tilting on the internal Alfven timescale of the CT. Preliminary
	results employing a 3-D, resistive MHD code show rapid tilting with
	the CT aligning its magnetic moment with the tokamak field. Requirements
	for an experimental test of CT injection and scenarios for fueling
	a reactor are also discussed},

	which may in turn give rise to considerable benefits for a tight
	aspect ratio reactor. The authors consider the properties of extremely
	light aspect ratios, down to 1.2 or less. Simulations have been carried
	out which show that the increase in ohmic heating due to the neo-classical
	enhancement of Spitzer resistivity can be a factor of 6 or 7 at <i>A</i>=1.2.
	Equilibrium studies have demonstrated a large increase in edge safety
	factor due to toroidicity and shaping effects, which enables large
	increases in plasma current whilst keeping <i>q</i><sub>a</sub> high
	(and hence giving kink stability at low toroidal field). Computer
	studies of MHD properties indicate complete or partial stabilisation
	of some important tokamak internal instabilities-the 2/1 tearing
	mode and the `sawtooth' instability; and the `bootstrap current',
	important for tokamak self-sustainment, may increase at tight aspect
	ratio. Tight aspect ratio plasmas are naturally `D' shaped, and at
	high current they feature a considerable paramagnetic effect as in
	the pinch and spheromak, which has significant benefit to the `triple

  abstract  = {The Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment (SSPX) [E. B. Hooper, L.
	D. Pearlstein, and R. H. Bulmer, Nucl. Fusion 39, 863 (1999)] uses
	a magnetized coaxial gun to form and sustain spheromaks by helicity
	injection. Internal probes give the magnetic profile within the gun.
	An analysis of these data show that a number of commonly applied
	assumptions are not completely correct, and some previously unrecognized
	processes may be at work. Specifically, the fraction of the available
	vacuum flux spanning the gun that is stretched out of the gun is
	variable and not usually 100%. The n=1 mode that is present during
	sustained discharges has its largest value of &delta;B/B within the
	gun, so that instantaneously B within the gun is not axisymmetric.
	By applying a rigid-rotor model to account for the mode, the instantaneous
	field and current structure within the gun are determined. The current
	density is also highly nonaxisymmetric and the local value of &lambda;&equiv;&mu;<sub>0</sub>j<sub>||</sub>/B
	is not constant, although the global value &lambda;<sub>g</sub>&equiv;&mu;<sub>0</sub>I<sub>g</sub>/&psi;<sub>g</sub>
	closely matches that expected by axisymmetric models. The current
	distribution near the gun muzzle suggests a cross-field current exists,
	and this is explained as a line-tying reaction to plasma rotation},

	a transient internal probe (TIP) diagnostic to measure the internal

	TIP is a diagnostic that makes a spatially resolved (i.e., not chord

	A 1-cm by 4-mm-diameter verdet probe is fired through the plasma
	at about 2 km/s by a two-stage light gas gun. The probe is illuminated
	by an argon ion laser throughout the traverse of the plasma-the retro-reflected
	light is then analyzed with an ellipsometer to determine the field
	at each location. The speed, small size of the probe, and the probe
	cladding make this measurement possible even in hot plasmas (100
	s of eV). The measurement is accurate enough (1 MHz, &plusmn;7 G,
	1-cm spatial resolution) to map out magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) mode
	amplitudes from the edge to the magnetic axis},

	confinement has been demonstrated in slowly decaying spheromaks with

  abstract={The Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment (SSPX) was a high-temperature ( T e up to 0.5Â keV) spheromak formed by coaxial helicity injection (CHI) and with plasma duration of a few milliseconds following the high-current formation stage. Clean walls and low impurity operation were obtained by a combination of baking, discharge cleaning and titanium deposition on the walls, allowing the generation of high-quality plasmas. Resistive-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, benchmarked to the experiment, were used to elucidate the physics. The detailed characteristics of the n ÏÂ =Â 1 toroidal mode associated with CHI were determined as was the physics of the nonlinear current drive and magnetic reconnection that formed and sustained the spheromak. If the helicity injection rate was reduced following formation the plasma became relatively quiescent and magnetic surfaces formed. The measured thermal diffusivity in the core was as low as âŒ1Â m 2Â s â1 . However, reconnection events during buildup or sustainment of the plasma current by CHI were found to open magnetic surfaces throughout the plasma allowing rapid energy loss to the walls. As a result, experiments and simulations in SSPX found no path to simultaneous sustainment by CHI and good energy confinement. Additional physics results are also presented in this review.}

	spheromaks in the profiles of the ratio of current to magnetic field
	and of the safety factor. Ideal MHD modelling with Taylor relaxed
	profiles in the injector predicts that the safety factor in the confined
	region will generally lie between 0.5 and 1, with a divergence on
	the separatrix since the open field lines carry current from the
	injector. The safety factor can be single or double valued, depending
	on the current profile. The modelling predicts that there are no

	associated with the dynamo which drives the discharge current. The

  abstract  = {The Compact Toroid Injection Experiment (CTIX) produces spheromak-like
	compact toroids (SCTs) without external power switching, initiating
	a discharge by pulsed gas injection into a formation region containing
	a seed magnetic field generated by a solenoidal coil. After formation,
	the plasma is driven by an inductively delayed capacitor bank into
	an acceleration region, where surface axial and toroidal magnetic
	fields are measured at several axial positions. Due to strong eddy-current
	effects, formation-region magnetic field cannot be simply computed;
	instead, it is measured using the response of axial and radial test
	coils in the formation region to short solenoid test current pulses.
	A temporal and spatial reconstruction method is developed allowing
	formation-region field to be computed from the test-coil data for
	any CTIX discharge of identical solenoid geometry. By varying the
	peak value and timing of solenoidal current, curves of peak accelerator-region
	field as a function of initial formation-region field are developed.
	Curves of peak accelerator-region axial magnetic field are thereby
	found to be highly nonlinear functions of formation-region field,
	showing a threshold value for the formation-region field of approximately
	5 G, above which acceleration-region field saturates at values between
	2 and 12 kG. The direction of acceleration-region axial field reverses
	sign when the direction of solenoid current is reversed. Saturated
	accelerator-region axial field is a function of axial position and
	accelerator voltage, and is typically comparable to toroidal field

	axial field commonly exceeds 1000 near the onset of saturation. This
	large amplification is of practical advantage for delayed plasma
	breakdown on CTIX, allowing a modest seed field to produce high poloidal
	fields, which are necessary for intense SCT acceleration. The results
	may also provide a useful benchmark for numerical simulation of the
	conversion of abundant toroidal field into poloidal field in a plasma
	with comparatively low dissipation.},

	Due to the requirements of high initial density of ~10<sup>17</sup>
	cm<sup>-3</sup>, strong internal fields of 5-10 T, and base temperatures
	of &gt;100 eV, a design based on conical compression electrodes is
	an effective avenue to pursue. Progress is being made at General
	Fusion Inc, (Vancouver, Canada) to develop a pair of large CT accelerators
	for generating an MTF target plasma. In this design, tungsten coated
	conical electrodes (with a formation diameter of 1.9 m, a radial
	compression factor of 4, and overall accelerator length of 5 m) will
	be used to achieve ohmic heating and acceleration of the CT, yet
	with low wall sputtering rates. A pair of these accelerators can
	be synchronized and shot at one another, producing a collision and
	reconnection of the two CTs within the center of an MTF chamber.
	Depending on the choice of relative helicities, the two CTs will
	merge to form either a spheromak-like or an FRC-like plasma.},

	(SCTs) to fuel tokamak plasmas have quantified the penetration mechanism
	in the low beta regime; i.e. external magnetic field pressure dominates
	plasma thermal pressure. However, fusion reactor designs require
	high beta plasma and, more importantly, the proper plasma pressure
	profile. Here, the effect of the plasma pressure profile on SCT penetration,
	specifically, the effect of diamagnetism, is addressed. It is estimated
	that magnetic field pressure dominates penetration even up to 50%
	local beta. The combination of the diamagnetic effect on the toroidal
	magnetic field and the strong poloidal field at the outer major radius
	of a spherical tokamak will result in a diamagnetic well in the total
	magnetic field. Therefore, the spherical tokamak is a good candidate
	to test the potential trapping of an SCT in a high beta diamagnetic
	well. The diamagnetic effects of a high beta spherical tokamak discharge
	(low aspect ratio) are computed. To test the penetration of an SCT
	into such a diamagnetic well, experiments have been conducted of
	SCT injection into a vacuum field structure which simulates the diamagnetic
	field effect of a high beta tokamak. The diamagnetic field gradient
	length is substantially shorter than that of the toroidal field of
	the tokamak, and the results show that it can still improve the penetration
	of the SCT. Finally, analytic results have been used to estimate
	the effect of plasma pressure on penetration, and the effect of plasma
	pressure was found to be small in comparison with the magnetic field
	pressure. The penetration condition for a vacuum field only is reported.
	To study the diamagnetic effect in a high beta plasma, additional
	experiments need to be carried out on a high beta spherical tokamak},

	Ohmic heating is enhanced by adiabatic compression because of further

	the ultra-low-<i>q</i> discharge. A typical example of device and
	plasma parameters with compression ratio 5 and safety factor 0.5
	is as follows; major radius/minor radius=2 m/0.5 m, energy confinement
	time required for Ohmic ignition is less than 0.2 s, plasma current
	density is 50 MA/m<sup>2</sup>, and the total plasma current is 1.6
	MA. Without compression a longer energy confinement time and larger

	are presented. An introduction and brief history is followed by a
	discussion of generalized helicity and its time derivative. Formation
	and sustainment are discussed including five different methods, flux
	core, &thetas;-pinch z-pinch, coaxial source, conical &thetas;-pinch,
	and kinked z-pinch. All methods use helicity injections. Steady-state
	methods and rules for designing spheromak experiments are covered,
	followed by equilibrium and stability. Methods of stabilizing the
	tilt and shift modes are discussed as well as their impact on the
	reactor designs. Current-driven and pressure-driven instabilities
	as well as relaxation in general are covered. Energy confinement
	is discussed in terms of helicity decay time and and &beta;s limits.
	The confinement in high and low open-flux geometries are compared
	and the reactor implications discussed},

  abstract  = {New understanding and improved parameters have been achieved on the
	Helicity Injected Torus with Steady Inductive helicity injection
	current drive (HIT-SI) experiment. The experiment has a bowtie-shaped
	spheromak confinement region with two helicity injectors. The inductive
	injectors are 180&deg; segments of a small, oval cross section toroidal
	pinch. Spheromaks with currents up to 38 kA and current amplification
	of 2 have been achieved with only 6 MW of injector power. The Taylor-state
	model is shown to agree with HIT-SI surface and internal magnetic
	profile measurements. Helicity balance predicts the peak magnitude
	of toroidal spheromak current and the threshold for spheromak formation.
	The model also accurately predicts the division of the applied loop
	voltage between the injector and spheromak regions. Single injector
	operation shows that the two injectors have opposing, preferred spheromak
	current directions. An electron locking relaxation model is consistent
	with the preferred direction, with ion Doppler data and with bolometric
	data. Results from higher frequency operation are given. The impact
	of the new understanding on the future direction of the HIT programme
	is discussed.},

	is determined. Consequences of the shifting of the mode rational
	surface in response to the injected current are explored, and the

  abstract  = {Since its inception at the 1997 Innovative Confinement Concept meeting,
	the Self-organized Plasma with Induction, Reconnection, and Injection
	Techniques (SPIRIT) concept has been continuously advanced both theoretically
	and experimentally. The main features of this concept are: (1) formation
	of large-flux Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasmas by merging
	two spheromaks with opposite helicities; (2) flexibility to assess
	FRC stability by varying the plasma shape and kinetic parameter,
	by using passive stabilizers, and by injecting energetic ions; (3)
	sustainment of the FRC for a time significantly longer than the energy
	confinement time using an ohmic transformer and/or neutral beam injection.
	Experiments carried out in TS-&frac34; and SSX and more recently
	in Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) have further verified the
	effectiveness of this formation scheme for large-flux FRCs. An improved
	understanding of FRC stability over plasma shape and kinetic parameter
	has been obtained in MRX. New numerical simulations showed that FRC
	plasmas can be globally stabilized by injecting energetic ions. Many
	of these aspects of the SPIRIT concept can be further studied in
	the current MRX device.},

	heat flux and the collisionless heat flux for high and low collisionalities,

	moderately collisional or nearly collisionless plasmas often leads
	higher heat flux than the integral closure. This fact is consistent

  abstract  = {Summary form only given, as follows. The tendency of plasmas to relax
	toward a minimum energy state while satisfying the constraint of
	constant helicity has been confirmed in spheromak and RFP experiments.
	This tendency is exploited in the coaxial helicity injection current
	drive technique that is the central feature of the helicity injected
	tokamak (HIT) experiment. In HIT, current is initially driven on
	outer (open) flux surfaces, and then relaxation toward the minimum
	energy state leads to rearrangement of the magnetic configuration
	so that the current is driven throughout the plasma and is amplified.
	In this study, we attempt to gain a better understanding of how the
	plasma evolves during this relaxation process by doing high-resolution,
	numerical MHD simulations of several simple plasma configurations,
	including planar and cylindrical current sheets. The MHD simulations
	are done using a new implicit MHD code based on an approximate Riemann
	solver technique},

	been successfully made on the CTCC-II spheromak. The electron temperatures
	obtained in the core plasma are 20-80 eV, which are consistent with
	the values obtained by Thomson scattering. This measurement has the
	advantage of giving the time evolution of the electron temperature
	within a single plasma discharge. In the CTCC spheromak, intermittent
	instability (stepwise instability) and its relaxation are frequently
	observed. During the stepwise instability and its relaxation cycles,
	increase and decrease in the temperature are observed in the current-profile-peaking
	phase and the nonlinear saturation phase of the n=2 mode. It is demonstrated
	that the temperature profile in the peripheral plasma can be controlled
	by an additional magnetic field (choking field), which can reduce
	the error field in the entrance hole of the flux conserver},

  abstract  = {The TS-3 device at the University of Tokyo has been used to produce
	free boundary spheromaks or spheromak-like compact toroids. Plasma
	production is accomplished either by Z-&thetas; discharges or by
	means of magnetized coaxial plasma guns installed at both ends of
	the device. The plasmas produced have a minor&ap;major radius of
	about 15 to 20 cm with a natural decay time of about 30 to 50 &mu;s
	and a toroidal plasma current of about 30 to 60 kA. A unique feature
	of TS-3 device is the possession of production regions at both ends
	of the device, and consequently the ability of producing two adjacent
	compact toroids which can be merged through magnetic reconnection.
	Another feature of TS-3 device is the possibility of external application
	of a toroidal field with the aid of an optional center conductor
	assembly that can carry an axial current ranging from 0 to &plusmn;80
	kA. This construction enables us to produce compact toroidal plasmas
	of various types from reversed field pinch(RFP) to tokamak in terms
	of the difference in q profile. The variation of both poloidal plasma
	current and external toroidal field current permits the change in
	magnetic configuration of merging plasmas, enabling the reconnection
	angle to continuously vary from about 20&deg; (tokamak merging) through
	90&deg; (cohelicity spheromak merging) to 180&deg; (counter-helicity
	spheromak merging to produce field reversed configurations(FRC)).
	When the coaxial guns are installed at both ends of the device in
	place of the center conductor, a center plasma current can be injected
	to form flux-core spheromaks (or bumpy z-pinches). Novel research
	subjects that have emerged from TS-3 experiments are: (1) the investigation
	of three dimensional effects of magnetic reconnection in laboratory
	plasmas, (2) the formation of FRC plasmas by a counter-helicity spheromak
	merging, (3) non-OH production and merging of tight aspect ratio
	tokamaks, (4) the stabilization of tilt motions of tight aspect ratio
	tokamaks, and (5) the formation and compression (flux amplification)
	of free-boundary tilt stabilized flux-core spheromaks},

  abstract = {At the University of Tokyo the TS-3 machine, with a z-&thetas; pinch
	type spheromak formation scheme, has been used to produce a pair
	of free boundary compact toroids with a minor radius of about 15
	cm. Their toroidal plasma currents of about 30 kA are induced in
	the same direction to permit the plasmas to merge through forced
	(driven) magnetic reconnection. Their toroidal magnetic fields, which
	are produced by the poloidal plasma currents, are made either parallel
	or antiparallel, permitting the investigation of the 3-D effects
	of the magnetic reconnection. A central cylindrical conductor with
	a current of -20 kA (RFP region) to 120 kA (tokamak region) is used
	to apply an external toroidal field to these merging toroids. The
	variation of both poloidal plasma currents and external toroidal
	field currents permits the change in magnetic configuration of the
	merging plasmas, enabling the reconnection angle to vary continuously
	from about 20&deg; (tokamak merging) through 90&deg; (cohelicity
	spheromak merging) to 180&deg; (counterhelicity spheromak merging).
	It is found that both merging speed and ion heating increase with
	increasing reconnection angle. This result suggests the possibility
	of systematically interpreting the different nature of plasma behaviour
	in different current carrying toroidal plasmas in terms of the different
	3-D effects of magnetic reconnection},

  abstract  = {The TSP-AST tokamak is a new version of the TSP tokamak in which use
	is made of the adiabatic plasma compression over the major radius
	and formation of the spherical configuration in the final position.
	One of the requirements imposed on the TSP-AST tokamak is to make
	the most use of the main components of the existing TSP tokamak,
	to maintain the main mounting dimensions, weight-dimension characteristics
	and to keep the unique power supply system. The tokamak is designed
	to attain the limiting plasma parameters in the spherical configuration
	at powerful adiabatic compression; to define the plasma confinement
	scaling depending on A, k, and R at different positions of the plasma
	core along the vacuum vessel elongated over R, with the toroidal
	field, current and main plasma parameters remaining unchanged; to
	control the plasma core shape and to search for the equilibrium conditions,
	with the plasma detached considerably from the conducting wall elements.
	The total current in the magnets is 7.5 MA. The toroidal magnetic
	fields, B<sub>T</sub> = 1.5 T and B<sub>T</sub> = 3.5 T, are generated
	on the radius R<sub>0</sub> = 1 m and R<sub>0</sub> = 0.45 m, respectively.
	Despite relatively low magnetic field produced on the plasma core
	axis, the magnets of the TSP-AST tokamak operates under high electromagnetic
	loads. Therefore, development of an appropriate construction presents
	considerable engineering problems},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given, as follows. Experimental evidence is presented
	for the formation, formerly predicted, of a closed, spheromak-like
	magnetic configuration (SLMC) by the plasma-focus-self-transformed
	magnetic field. The SLMC formation is characterized by (1) self-consistent
	generation of a poloidal magnetic field (the dynamo effect); (2)
	strong filamentation of electric currents; (3) stimulating role of
	the enhanced propagation rate of the magnetic field along the anode,
	due to the Hall effect; (4) a magnetic field reconnection process
	leading to the formation of the SLMC as a closed configuration, appears
	to occur before the the current sheath converges on the axis; (5)
	in its final stage, the SLMC takes the form of a squeezed spheromak
	configuration compressed and forced away from the anode by the residual
	azimuthal magnetic field; (6) the power density in the combined Z-&part;
	pinch at major axis of the SLMC exceeds, by several orders of magnitude,
	the peak power density in the experiments on the force-free flux-conserver-confined
	spheromak; (7) the SLMC exhibits a cyclical tendency to form, be
	repelled from the anode, and reform repeatedly. The results suggest
	a possibility of further concentrating the plasma power density by
	means of compressing the SLMC-trapped plasma by the residual magnetic
	field},

  abstract  = {Because of its high confinement properties, the H-mode provides good
	opportunities to achieve high beta values in a tokamak. In this paper
	the results of an experimental study of &beta;<sub>T</sub> and &beta;<sub>N</sub>
	limits in the H-mode, obtained in a circular cross section tokamak
	without auxiliary heating are presented. The experiments were performed
	in the TUMAN-3M tokamak. The device has the following parameters:
	R<sub>0</sub>=0.53 m, a<sub>l</sub>=0.22 m (limiter configuration),
	&beta;<sub>T</sub>&les;1.2 T, I<sub>p</sub>&les;175 kA, &ntilde;<sub>e</sub>&les;6.2&times;10<sup>19</sup>
	m<sup>-3</sup>. The stored energy was measured using diamagnetic
	loops and compared with W calculated from kinetic data obtained by
	Thomson scattering and microwave interferometry. Measurements of
	the stored energy and of the &beta; were performed in the ohmic H-mode
	before and after boronization and in the scenario with fast current
	ramp-down in ohmic H-mode. A maximum value of &beta;<sub>T</sub>
	of 2.0% and &beta;<sub>N</sub> of 2.0 were achieved. The &beta;<sub>N</sub>
	limit achieved reveals itself as a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; (non-disruptive)
	limit. The stored energy slowly decays after the current ramp-down.
	No correlation was found between beta restriction and MHD phenomena.
	Internal transport barrier (ITB) formation was observed in ohmic
	H-mode. An enhancement factor of 2.0 over ITER93H (ELM-free) was
	found in the ohmic H-mode with ITB},

  abstract  = {The focus of the TUMAN-3 and TUMAN-3M tokamaks programme is on issues
	of improved confinement. The transition from an ordinary ohmic regime
	into improved confinement mode has been found in circular limiter
	configuration in a vessel with all-metallic walls and limiters. The
	signatures of the H-mode in auxiliary heated tokamaks have been observed
	in this regime. The crucial role of the radial electric field was
	found in experiments with internal probe biasing. Other techniques
	were demonstrated to trigger H-mode: short increase of the working
	gas puffing rate, minor radius magnetic compression and pellet injection.
	The scaling of the energy confinement time in ohmic H-mode was obtained,
	which differs dramatically from the scaling for the ordinary ohmic
	regime. A strong dependence of &tau;<sub>E</sub> on plasma current
	was found. The &tau;<sub>E</sub> scaling for the ohmic H-mode is
	consistent with the scaling proposed for devices with powerful auxiliary
	heating (JET/DIII-D H-mode scaling). The result shows that H-mode
	physics is universal in tokamaks with different geometries and heating
	methods. In 1994 a new vacuum vessel was installed in the TUMAN-3
	tokamak. The modified device, TUMAN-3M, is able to produce higher
	BT and I<sub>p</sub>, up to 2 T and 0.2 MA, respectively. During
	the first operational period a plasma current of 0.15 MA was achieved
	at B<sub>T</sub>=0.8 T, which corresponded to g<sup>cyl</sup>=2.6.
	The impact of the quality of wall coating on confinement was asserted.
	The longest energy confinement time (30 ms) was observed under the
	conditions of best boronization},

	The beam evolution is calculated through a Monte-Carlo simulation
	and the plasma MHD equilibrium is determined self-consistently with
	the current produced by the beam. The exact equations of motion are
	used for the beam particles instead of the usual guiding-centre approximation.
	The guiding-centre trajectories are clearly different from the actual
	particle trajectories and this difference produces discrepancies
	in the total driven current and in the current profiles. A reduction
	of the plasma effective charge, Z<sub>eff</sub>, does not result
	in an improvement in the current drive efficiency because the reduction
	of the stopping cross section is compensated by an increase in the
	electron cancelling current. The safety factor profile of the self-consistent
	equilibria shows a clear sensitivity to the driven current profile.
	The value at the magnetic axis (q<sub>0</sub>) diminishes when the
	beam is injected at the magnetic axis and increases for injection
	above the axis. Power deposition profiles for simple injection configurations

	(MHD) simulation are compared to experimental data from the Swarthmore
	Spheromak Experiment (SSX) [M. R. Brown, Phys. Plasmas <b>6</b>,
	1717 (1999)]. The MHD simulation is run under conditions and with
	dimensionless parameters similar to the experiment (Lundquist number
	S=1000, plasma beta &beta;=0.1). The simulation is shown to reproduce
	global equilibrium magnetic field profiles of the spheromaks as well
	as much of the detailed reconnection dynamics measured when two spheromaks
	are merged. It is concluded that SSX merger dynamics may be characterized
	as MHD reconnection, with the likelihood that extensions are needed
	to account for kinetic effects in the associated current sheet. High
	spatial and temporal resolution MHD simulation data will be used
	as input for a particle orbit and energization code},

	completed by the derivation of a general expression for the field's
	spherical curl transform. This enables the transform space representation
	of a given field to be determined and compared with that of other
	fields, assisting the analysis and classification of this type of
	magnetic field as well as providing a basis for generalization. The
	result obtained gives the spherical curl transform as a weighted
	projection of the vector Radon transform of the field on the appropriate
	curl eigenvector. The process is exemplified by the determination
	of the transforms of three fields: the simplest force-free magnetic
	field, and the Lundquist and classical spheromak fields. The latter
	two are both of interest as models of the magnetic fields of solar
	magnetic clouds, while the classical spheromak field is relevant
	to the design of nuclear fusion reactors as well. The use of the
	transform in generalizing the Lundquist field is briefly discussed.

  abstract  = {The non-linear evolution of several unstable equilibria, representative
	of helicity-injected spheromak configurations inside a cylindrical
	flux conserver, is studied by means of three dimensional resistive
	MHD simulations. These equilibria are force-free (&nabla; x B = &lambda;(&psi;)B)
	but do not correspond to minimum energy states, having linear &lambda;(&psi;)
	profiles with negative slope. Several aspects of this process are
	studied (magnetic energy relaxation, selective helicity decay, relaxed
	profiles) for different initial A slopes. The stability threshold
	predicted by linear theory is recovered. The results show that complete
	plasma relaxation leading to a uniform A, is achieved only if the
	initial profile is hollow enough. The evolution for cases just above
	the stability threshold is more gentle and does not end in a Taylor
	state. The final state in these cases has a linear &lambda;(&psi;)
	profile, as the initial condition, but with a smaller slope.},

	substantial advantages as a fusion reactor concept over larger, more
	complicated, and more costly devices such as the tokamak. The very
	definite advantages associated with the simply closed geometry, minimized
	external coil requirements and the possibility of ohmic ignition
	in the spheromak, represent a substantial improvement over conventional
	magnetic fusion reactor designs. Furthermore, recent successes in
	improving confinement parameters (T<sub>e</sub>~400 eV, T<sub>i</sub>~1
	keV, n<sub>e</sub>~5&times;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, B~1 T)
	have renewed interest in advancing this concept to a proof of principle,
	reactor prototype stage. Herein, the initial work by Fowler et al.
	(Comments Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 16 (1994) 91), indicating
	the possibility of ohmic ignition in spheromaks, is extended to a
	two fluid model that includes direct ion heating. Non-ohmic magnetic
	dissipation, contributing to direct ion heating, and confinement
	scaling are quantified through comparison with the latest results
	from the gun driven Compact Torus Experiment (CTX) spheromak (Phys.
	Fluids B 2 (1990) 1342). Excellent agreement is demonstrated between
	experimentally measured plasma parameters and our model predictions.
	Extrapolation to ignition experiments and reactor relevant conditions
	is discussed, indicating the possibility of reaching these conditions
	by gun driven ohmic heating alone and illustrating the merits of
	direct ion heating. Conservative to pessimistic confinement estimates
	are used throughout so as to ensure that the promise offered by this
	concept does not presume unrealizable improvements in energy containment},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. It is pointed out that the edge helicity
	dissipation model can be applied to spheromaks with magnetic field
	errors at the plasma boundary or edge where the effective electric
	field for helicity dissipation is determined by the Paschen breakdown
	condition in H<sub>2</sub>. Employing this model and the standard
	CTX equilibrium model, the authors seek to make some predictions
	about physical observables for the CTX spheromak. In particular,
	they are interested in predicting the amount of current drive attributable
	to the decay of magnetic flux and to relaxation currents. It is demonstrated
	that relaxation currents make up a significant contribution to the
	total spheromak current drive and are nonsingle fluid MHD in nature},

	several new type of CT/ST (compact tori and spherical tokamak): merging
	formation of FRCs(field reversed configuration), magnetic reconnection
	experiment, and ultra-high beta ST formation. The successful results
	of these experiments have enabled us to construct an up-scaled merging
	device; namely the TS-4. The new device TS-4 has two flux cores(major
	radius = 0.5m) for inductive plasma formation, a center coil (external
	toroidal field coil and OH coil) for q value control and plasma sustainment,
	and DC external field coils. The initial operation of the TS-4 (since
	2001) demonstrated co-helicity and counter-helicity merging of two
	spheromaks. The counter-helicity merging revealed annihilation of
	toroidal magnetic field with a significant overshoot motion of reconnected
	field lines. It resulted in the formation of an high-beta (&ap; 0.8)
	FRC. The produced FRC has a significant field deformation, suggesting
	contribution of toroidal plasma flow to its equilibrium. The co-helicity
	merging doubled the toroidal fluxes of spheromak, causing its flux
	conversion from toroidal to poloidal. The merging spheromaks relaxed
	into another spheromak with beta &ap; 0, suggesting the large thermal
	energy loss due to its non-axisymmetric dynamo activity},

	dimensionless parameter experiments and plasmas. DB3 also contains
	an increased amount of data from a range of diverted machines and
	further data at high triangularity, high density and high current.
	A wide range of physics studies has been performed on DB3 with particular
	progress made in the separation of core and edge behaviour, dimensionless
	parameter analyses and the comparison of the database with one-dimensional
	transport codes. The errors in the physics variables of the database

  abstract  = {We are in the process of testing a technique for measuring the magnetic-field
	line topology in magnetically confined plasmas. The basic idea is
	to use a high-powerful short-pulse laser to launch a burst of energetic
	(~100 keV) electrons from a target passing through the plasma of
	interest; these electrons then generally follow field lines until
	they strike a solid surface, where a burst of x rays is produced
	and then detected. The field line connection length can be determined
	from the time delay between the laser pulse and the burst of x rays.
	The topology of the field lines can be inferred by measuring the
	connection length as a function of initial target location inside
	the plasma. Measuring the spatial distribution of the x-ray production
	will provide further information on the field topology, including
	the effects of magnetic-field fluctuations and stochasticity. The
	work will eventually include testing the appropriate x-ray detectors,
	measuring the background x-ray emission in a spheromak plasma, measuring
	the energetic electron production by a short-pulse high-power laser,
	and making preliminary measurements of the edge field line topology
	in the Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment using a pulsed electron-beam
	source as a prototype for a laser-based source. This technique may
	have broad application to a variety of plasma configurations and
	provide physics data applicable to a wide range of plasma physics
	problems},

  abstract  = {The design and operation of a spheromak-like compact toroid (SCT)
	plasma accelerator is described. As an example application, some
	principles are presented for using the device as a plasma injector
	to fuel a tokamak plasma. The device forms and accelerates an SCT
	plasma. The SCT is a self-contained structure of plasma with embedded
	poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields and their associated currents
	that provide plasma confinement and structural integrity. The SCT
	is formed in a magnetized coaxial plasma gun and then accelerated
	within coaxial electrodes. The typical mass of an SCT for tokamak
	fueling is from several tens to several hundreds of micrograms and
	is accelerated up to a velocity of ~2&times;10<sup>5</sup> m/s. Larger-mass
	SCTs can be produced, and higher velocities are possible. This is
	important for other applications such as space propulsion, X-ray
	generation, fast-opening plasma switches, and low-temperature high-density
	plasma simulators. The novel features of the device are as follows:
	(a) it can he operated in a repetitive mode, (b) the high-energy
	capacitor bank to form the SCT is switched by initiating breakdown
	with fast gas injection, (c) the required delay between formation
	and acceleration is achieved passively with saturable inductors that
	switch the high-energy accelerator capacitor bank, and (d) a drift
	section has been added within the toroidal field region to study
	cross-field propagation prior to tokamak penetration. With the device
	installed on the Davis Diverted Tokamak (DDT), measurements are taken
	to study tokamak fueling. Typical rep-rated parameters are as follows:
	the SCT poloidal magnetic field at the outer electrode=0.4 T, the
	stored acceleration bank energy=1600 J, and the stored accelerator
	bank energy=3600 J. The lower bound on SCT kinetic energy, leaving
	the accelerator=40 J (inferred from electron line density measurements).
	Typical SCT velocity is 15 to 20 cm/&mu;s. The maximum rep-rate achieved
	so far with the device is 0.2 Hz and is currently limited by vacuum
	pumping capacity. Reliable operation has been demonstrated for 1000
	consecutive shots. Higher-energy single shots have also been taken
	to study SCT propagation through an open guide tube and to study
	penetration of the SCT into the DDT tokamak vessel with both tokamak
	plasma discharges and vacuum toroidal magnetic field only},

	the START vacuum vessel) aims to study the properties of a spherical
	torus (ST), where a hydrogen force-free screw pinch (SP, with open
	field lines and fed by electrodes) replaces the central rod of the
	standard spherical tokamak experiments: PROTO-SPHERA, with a central
	screw pinch current I<sub>e</sub> = 60 kA, aims at producing a spherical
	torus (with closed field lines) of diameter 2 R<sub>sph</sub> = 70
	cm, and aspect ratio R/a = A = 1.2-1.3, carrying a toroidal current
	I<sub>p</sub> = 120-240 kA. Such a configuration is an evolution
	of the flux core spheromak (FCS) concept, first proposed by Taylor.
	The formation mechanism of the configuration will be the one successfully
	developed by the TS-3 team at the University of Tokyo. The spherical
	torus toroidal current should be sustained by helicity injection
	from the screw pinch, therefore some level of resistive instability
	with toroidal mode numbers n = 1 and/or n = 2 is requested after
	the formation and during the sustainment phase; nevertheless, the
	configuration should be operated such as to maintain it stable from
	an ideal MHD point of view. The ideal MHD stability limits of PROTO-SPHERA
	have been analysed by a numerical code able to handle magnetic configurations
	endowed with both closed and open magnetic field lines. The results
	of such an analysis are presented in terms of the main parameter,
	which is the ratio between the currents in the spherical torus and
	in the central screw pinch, I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>e</sub>, and of other
	relevant parameters of the ST (elongation, aspect ratio, total beta
	and the toroidal plasma current profile). A comparison with the TS-3
	results is also shown.},

  abstract  = {Liquids (~7 neutron mean free paths thick), with certain restrictions,
	can probably be used in magnetic fusion designs between the burning
	plasma and the structural materials of the fusion power core. If
	this works there would be a number of profound advantages: a cost
	of electricity lower by as much as a factor of 2; removal of the
	need to develop new first wall materials, saving over 4 billion US
	dollars in development costs; a reduction of the amount and kinds
	of wastes generated in the plant; and the wider choice of materials
	permitted. The amount of material that evaporates from the liquid
	which can be allowed to enter the burning plasma is estimated to
	be less than 0.7% for lithium, 1.9% for Flibe (Li<sub>2</sub>BeF<sub>4</sub>
	or LiBeF<sub>3</sub>) and 0.01% for Li<sub>17</sub>Pb<sub>83</sub>.
	The ability of the edge plasma to attenuate the vapour by ionization
	appears to exceed this requirement. This ionized vapour would be
	swept along open field lines into a remote burial chamber. The most
	practical systems would be those with topological open field lines
	on the outer surface, as is the case with a field reversed configuration
	(FRC), a spheromak, a Z pinch or a mirror machine. In a tokamak,
	including a spherical tokamak, the field lines outside the separatrix
	are restricted to a small volume inside the toroidal coil making
	for difficulties in introducing the liquid and removing the ionized
	vapour, i.e. the configuration is not open ended},

  abstract  = {A power plant based on a spheromak device using liquid walls is analyzed.
	We assume a spheromak configuration can be made and sustained by
	a steady plasma gun current, which injects particles, current and
	magnetic field, i.e., helicity injection, which are transported into
	the core region. The magnetic configuration is evaluated with an
	axisymmetric free-boundary equilibrium code, where the current profile
	is tailored to support an average beta of 10%. An injection current
	of 100 kA (125 MW of gun power) sustains the toroidal current of
	40 MA. The magnetic flux linking the gun is 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of
	the flux in the spheromak. The geometry allows a flow of liquid,
	either molten salt, (flibe-Li<sub>2</sub>BeF<sub>4</sub> or flinabe-LiNaBeF<sub>4</sub>),
	or liquid metal such as SnLi, which protects most of the walls and
	structures from damage arising from neutrons and plasma particles.
	The free surface between the liquid and the burning plasma is heated
	primarily by bremsstrahlung, line radiation, and some by neutrons.
	The temperature of the free surface of the liquid is calculated and
	then the evaporation rate is estimated from vapor-pressure data.
	The impurity concentration in the burning plasma, about 0.8% fluorine,
	is limited to that giving a 20% reduction in the fusion power. The
	divertor power density of 620 MW/m<sup>2</sup> is handled by high-speed
	(100 m/s) liquid jets. Calculations show the tritium breeding is
	adequate with enriched <sup>6</sup>Li, and a design is given for
	the walls not covered by flowing liquid (~15% of the total). We identified
	a number of problem areas needing further study to make the design
	more self-consistent and workable, including lowering the divertor
	power density by expanding the flux tube size},

	formation technique is used to produce low aspect ratio tokamaks
	in an external toroidal field generated by the center conductor.
	Using this operation, the plasma stability has been investigated
	in the transition regime from tokamaks to spheromaks. It has been
	found that there exists a lower critical value of the center conductor
	current to suppress the global plasma instability of the n=1 tilt
	and/or shift modes. The ratio of this critical current to plasma
	current is experimentally measured for the first time as a function
	of the aspect ratio. Glass-tube cylindrical limiters with different
	radii are installed along the symmetric center axis of the Spherical
	Torus-3 device [Y. Ono et al., Phys. Fluids B 5, 3691 (1993)]. As
	the aspect ratio is decreased from 1.9 to 1.1, it is observed that
	the critical ratio of the center conductor current to plasma current
	decreases from 1.2 to 0.2. The safety factor q at the plasma edge
	corresponding to this critical current is roughly 1.5 to 3.0. Similar
	experiments are also carried out with a thin metal cover surrounding
	the surface of the glass tube limiter. The thin metal cover permits
	the decrease in the critical current and the corresponding edge q
	value of q~1. These experimental results of the critical current
	ratio are found to be comparable to that predicted from theoretical
	models where the restoring force against the tilt motion is considered
	to be generated by the interaction of the external toroidal field
	with the n=1 induced surface currents in the tilt motion},

	issues for an RFP fusion reactor operating at high power density;
	and to determine the potential economic (cost of electricity), operational
	(maintenance and availability), safety and environmental features
	of high mass-power-density fusion-reactor systems. Mass power density
	(MPD) is defined as the ratio of <i>net</i> electric output to the
	mass of the fusion power core (FPC). The FPC includes the plasma
	chamber, first wall, blanket, shield, magnets, and related structure.
	Two different detailed designs, TITAN-I and TITAN-II, have been produced
	to demonstrate the possibility of multiple engineering-design approaches
	to high-MPD reactors. TITAN-I is a self-cooled lithium design with
	a vanadium-alloy structure. TITAN-II is a self-cooled aqueous loop-in-pool
	design with 9-C ferritic steel as the structural material. Both designs
	use RFP plasmas operating with essentially the same parameters. Both
	conceptual reactors are based on the DT fuel cycle, have a net electric

	RFP confinement concept make possible compact fusion reactors with
	such a high MPD. The TITAN designs would meet the US criteria for
	the near-surface disposal of radioactive waste (Class C, 10CFR61)
	and would achieve a high Level of Safety Assurance with respect to
	FPC damage by decay afterheat and radioactivity release caused by
	accidents. Very importantly, a `single-piece' FPC maintenance procedure
	has been worked out and appears feasible for both designs. Parametric
	system studies have been used to find cost-optimized designs, to
	determine the parametric design window associated with each approach,
	and to assess the sensitivity of the designs to a wide range of physics
	and engineering requirements and assumptions},

  abstract  = {The TITAN reversed-field-pinch (RFP) fusion-reactor study has two
	objectives: to determine the technical feasibility and key developmental
	issues for an RFP fusion reactor operating at high power density;
	and to determine the potential economic operational, safety, and
	environmental features of high mass-power-density (MPD) fusion-reactor
	systems. Parametric system studies have been used to find cost-optimized
	designs. The design window for compact RFP reactors includes the
	range of 10-20 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. The reactors are physically small,
	and a potential benefit of this `compactness' is improved economics.
	The TITAN study adopted 18 MW/m<sup>2</sup> in order to assess the
	technical feasibility and physics limits for such high-MPD reactors.
	The TITAN-I design is a lithium self-cooled design with a vanadium-alloy
	(V-3Ti-1Si) structural material. The magnetic field topology of the
	RFP is favorable for liquid-metal cooling. The first wall and blanket
	consist of single pass poloidal-flow loops aligned with the dominant
	poloidal magnetic field. A unique feature of the TITAN-I design is
	the use of the integrated-blanket-coil (IBC) concept. The lithium
	coolant in the blanket circuit is also used as the electrical conductor
	of the toroidal-field and divertor coils. A `single-piece' FPC maintenance
	procedure is used, in which the first wall and blanket are removed
	and replaced by vertical lift of the components as a single unit.
	This unique approach permits the complete FPC to be made of a few
	factory-fabricated pieces, assembled on site into a single torus,
	and tested to full operational conditions before installation in
	the reactor vault. A low-activation, low-afterheat vanadium alloy
	is used as the structural material throughout the FPC in order to
	minimize the peak temperature during accidents and to permit near-surface
	disposal of waste. The safety analysis indicates that the liquid-metal-cooled
	TITAN-I design can be classified as passively safe, without reliance
	on any active safety systems. The results from the TITAN study support
	the technical feasibility, economic incentive, and operational attractiveness
	of compact, high-MPD RFP reactors. Many critical issues remain to
	be resolved, however},

	helicity injection (SIHI) spheromak experiment (HIT-SI) addresses
	critical issues for spheromaks, including current drive, operation
	at high beta, and confinement. HIT-SI features an optimal high-beta
	plasma shape and current profile, steady-state inductive operation,
	minimal plasma-wall interaction, and injected power always flowing
	into the plasma. HIT-SI has a "bow-tie" shaped 1.3 cm thick Cu flux
	conserver with major radius R=0.33 m and axial extent of 0.57 m.
	A half torus helicity injector at each end of the flux conserver
	produces conjugate sinusoidal flux (4 MW peak) and loop voltages
	(20 MW peak) at 5 kHz by IGBT-based switching power amplifiers. The
	injector loop voltage is provided by a series LC resonant tank "voltage
	circuit" with a novel amplitude feedback control method. The injector
	flux is generated by a direct pulse-width-modulated feedback "flux
	circuit". Injector flux and loop voltages are phase controlled to
	maintain power flow always inward. Insulating breaks for the oscillating
	flux and loop voltage are provided by a novel double viton o-ring
	system. HIT-SI uses the diagnostic suite previously used by the HIT-II
	experiment. Recent results show increased injector current with increased
	neutral gas fuelling in the injectors. Efforts are underway to improve
	wall conditioning by RF glow discharge cleaning and installation
	of an improved pumping system. Studies are underway to evaluate replacement
	of the present series resonance on the voltage circuit with a parallel
	resonance. This should eliminate the voltage steps of the square-wave
	driver from appearing on the transformer primary coil. The NIMROD
	code is used to perform 3D MHD simulations of HIT-SI. The HIT-SI
	injectors are modeled using high toroidal mode number (up to n=10)
	boundary conditions. Previous results have shown an increase in the
	spheromak n=0 component with increasing Lundquist number, and also
	after the injectors are shut off. Present modeling work includes
	extending the duration of injector sustainment, and continued simulation
	of spheromaks decay after injector shut off},

	adiabatic invariants give the peaked density profile n~1/q of trapped
	particles. Sharp gradients are predicted near the separatrix of divertor

	a parcel of trapped particles is displaced inward by the turbulent
	fluctuations, their parallel velocity must increase in order to keep
	the longitudinal invariant J constant. This is equivalent to adiabatic
	compression, and increases the density. The turbulence is assumed

	these simulations examine the transient process from the current

	caused by multi-helicity (current driven) kink modes. The low-q relaxations
	are classified into two types: the fast-type relaxation without n=2
	mode saturation and the slow-type relaxation with n=2 mode saturation.
	In these simulations, resistive current loss in the outer region

	its change during the relaxation phase. When the peaking of the conductivity
	profile is strong enough to decrease q<sub>0</sub> to much less than

  abstract  = {Spontaneous formation of toroidal flow was measured for the first
	time in oblate field-reversed configurations (FRCs) produced in TS-3
	and TS-4 experiments. The toroidal ion flow (V<sub>i</sub> &ap; 10
	kms<sup>-1</sup>) was found to peak around the magnetic axis, indicating
	that the FRC had a peaked ion current in sharp contrast to its hollow
	electric current. The peaked ion flow also indicated the formation
	of high flow shear inside the separatrix. The toroidal flow was observed
	to deform the magnetic field lines of the FRC, producing bipolar
	toroidal field profile. In high-s FRC (averaged number of ion gyro-radii
	in the separatrix: 's' = 4.5) with slow flow, its n = 1 mode kept
	growing, causing collapse of the whole configuration. However, in
	low-s FRC (s = 3) with fast flow, the rotating n = 2 mode (saturated)
	became dominant after n = 1 mode saturation. The spontaneous formation
	of flow-shear possibly transformed the n = 1 mode into the n = 2
	mode, suggesting a new sheared-flow stabilization of the n = 1 mode.
	The flow-shear was also generated artificially using the 'sling shot'
	effect of the counterhelicity reconnection. The n = 1 and 2 mode
	amplitudes were reduced to 1/5-1/10 due to the generated flow-shear.
	A new method for continuous sheared-flow generation was proposed
	for stabilization and heating of FRC by the use of intermittent merging

	two toroidal shape spheromak plasmas with major radii of 15-20 cm
	and with parallel toroidal currents of up to 30 kA collide to merge
	in an external equilibrium field. The experimental setup allows one
	to investigate magnetic reconnection comprehensively from both local

	This suggests the significance of a 3-D effect on the reconnection
	process. This difference is attributed to the property of the neutral
	current sheets with and without the magnetic field component parallel
	to the reconnection (X) line. In the counterhelicity merging, the
	neutral current sheet is compressed in much shorter time than in
	the cohelicity merging, resulting in much higher current density
	and subsequent faster decay of the current sheet. This induces a
	faster magnetic reconnection. The reconnection speed increases proportionally
	with the initial approaching speed of the spheromaks, suggesting
	that a compressible driven reconnection model is consistent with
	the reconnection experimental results},

	appear on signals of magnetic field, flux, <i>q</i> value, and electron
	temperature. Based on the internal magnetic field profiles measured
	by magnetic probe scans, the mechanisms and causes of these oscillations
	are revealed. The cycle of one oscillation consists of a toroidal
	current peaking phase and a subsequent relaxation phase. In the peaking
	phase, resistive current decay at the edge causes the spheromak to
	deviate from the initial minimum-energy Taylor state. The deviation
	was revealed experimentally by the preferential decay of toroidal
	flux over poloidal flux. A simple calculation shows that a peaking
	of the electron temperature profile is the most probable cause for
	the preferential decay of toroidal flux over poloidal flux. During
	the peaking phase, <i>q</i> decreases so low as to make the configuration
	unstable to low-<i>n</i> magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes (mainly
	<i>n</i>=2 mode). In the relaxation phase, these modes invoke current
	redistribution (relaxation), restoring the Taylor state. A significant
	finding in the relaxation phase is that a reversed toroidal field
	similar to that of the reversed-field pinch (RFP) configuration is
	sometimes measured at the edge of the plasma for a brief period.
	The disappearance or resistive decay of the reversed toroidal flux

	it undergoes rotation. The amount of rotation depends on plasma parameters,
	magnetic field amplitude and its orientation as well as on spatial
	variation. We have calculated the value of the rotation angle for
	different anisotropy conditions. It is observed that the amount of

	frequency of ECE radiation, a weak anisotropy condition can be satisfied.
	Hence measurement of ECE radiation for those range of frequencies
	(for which the weak anisotropy condition is satisfied), plasma parameters
	and magnetic field orientation can be obtained easily. As an example,
	the use of this diagnostic method in existing sustained spheromak

	are only moderately reduced. When flow shear across the H-mode pedestal
	is included, it is found that linear growth rates are increased,
	particularly for harmonics with high toroidal mode numbers. In nonlinear
	NIMROD simulations, ELM crashes produce filaments that extend out
	to the wall in the absence of flow shear. When flow shear is included,
	the filaments are dragged by the fluid and sheared off before they

	test particle simulation is run with dimensionless parameters similar
	to the experiment, and particles are permitted to escape when they
	encounter the simulated SSX boundaries. MHD activity related to reconnection
	is responsible for accelerating charged particles. The process includes

	The active formation time is about 10 &mu;sec. Without additional

	extends the stable field reversal time from 15 &mu;sec to 40 &mu;sec

	the standard Bessel function model are unexplained yet but may be
	connected with a static tilt. Unshielded types of figure-8-coils
	influence the formation process by a delay of the formation. However,
	they do not change the final equilibrium as compared with isolated
	types of passive coils. Thomson scattering and optical spectroscopy
	give electron temperatures which range from 5-10 eV at filling densities
	of 2*10<sup>+15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> around 20 eV at half this density.

  abstract  = {An O-mode Ultrashort Pulse Reflectometry (USPR) system has been designed
	and developed for the measurement of electron density profiles on
	the Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment (SSPX) spheromak. In the
	original design of SSPX, peak densities were envisioned to be in
	the range of 0.5-3&times;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. The total
	duration of formation and sustained discharges is typically ~2 msec.
	Moreover, diagnostic access on SSPX is severely restricted. Such
	high density and short duration plasmas coupled with stringent diagnostic
	access are quite challenging for conventional reflectometer systems.
	In USPR, the SSPX diagnostic requirements have been successfully
	satisfied by employing up-converting mixers and monostatic horn/waveguide
	configuration. As a result, the USPR system has proven its applicability
	for the density measurement of a future fusion device. In the density
	profile measurements, the USPR system is capable of routinely generating
	density profiles with a temporal resolution of 57 &mu;s. This paper
	presents details regarding the USPR fundamental principles, associated
	subsystems and laboratory tests as well as the experimental results

	[E. B. Hooper et al., Nucl. Fusion 39, 863 (1999)]. Reproducible
	plasma features have been identified with this diagnostic and divided
	into three groups, according to the stage in the discharge at which
	they occur: (i) breakdown and ejection, (ii) sustainment, and (iii)
	decay. During the first stage, plasma descends into the flux conserver
	shortly after breakdown and a transient plasma column is formed.
	The column then rapidly bends and simultaneously becomes too dim
	to photograph a few microseconds after formation. It is conjectured
	here that this rapid bending precedes the transfer of toroidal to
	poloidal flux. During sustainment, a stable plasma column different
	from the transient one is observed. It has been possible to measure
	the column diameter and compare it to CORSICA [A. Tarditi et al.,
	Contrib. Plasma Phys. 36, 132 (1996)], a magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium
	reconstruction code which showed good agreement with the measurements.
	Elongation and velocity measurements were made of cathode patterns
	also seen during this stage, possibly caused by pressure gradients
	or E&times;B drifts. The patterns elongate in a toroidal-only direction
	which depends on the magnetic-field polarity. During the decay stage
	the column diameter expands as the current ramps down, until it eventually
	dissolves into filaments. With the use of magnetic probes inserted
	in the gun region, an X point which moved axially depending on current
	level and toroidal mode number was observed in all the stages of
	the SSPX plasma discharge},

	in the context of a phenomenological model of magnetic helicity based
	on the topological constraint of minimum helicity in the open flux

	(i) the initial spheromak formation, i.e., when all flux surfaces

	average sense, and (ii) the stepwise increase of closed flux when
	operating the gun on a new mode that can apply a train of high-current
	pulses to the plasma. In the first stage, large kinks in the open
	flux surfaces are observed in the high-speed images taken shortly
	after plasma breakdown, and coincide with large magnetic asymmetries
	recorded in a fixed insertable magnetic probe that spans the flux
	conserver radius. Closed flux appears shortly after this. This stage
	is also investigated using resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations.
	In the second stage, a time lag in response between open and closed
	flux surfaces after each current pulse is interpreted as the time
	for the open flux to build helicity, before transferring it through
	reconnection to the closed flux. Large asymmetries are seen during
	these events, which then relax to a slowly decaying spheromak before

  abstract  = {We describe the design and operation of the SPHEX spheromak device
	and present an overview of its behaviour. The plasma is formed by
	ejection from a magnetized Marshall gun, and can be sustained as
	long as the gun is energized. The plasma is divided into the annulus
	comprising the closed toroidal flux, linked with the open flux forming
	the central column. The column current is driven directly by the
	central gun electrode, and the toroidal current in the annulus is
	driven indirectly by a mechanism associated with a coherent n=1 oscillation
	of the column. The configuration exemplifies the operation of the
	process of relaxation to a state of minimum magnetic energy, which
	leads to magnetic configurations similar to those observed; to sustain
	these configurations requires some mechanism of toroidal current
	drive. Associated with this is the amplification of the poloidal
	flux, which is typically a factor of about five larger than the flux
	generated by the gun solenoid; the constancy (to a first approximation)
	of this factor plays a controlling role in spheromak behaviour. In
	standard operating conditions there is a `hard' limit, set by the
	solenoid flux, on the current carried by the column; any current
	driven by the external circuit above this apparently does not emerge
	from the gun. Evidence is presented that the column current is carried
	largely (&gt;50%) by accelerated ions with energy up to the gun voltage
	(&ap;500 V for a typical gun current of 60 kA). These ions are poorly
	magnetized and can escape across the magnetic field to the wall,
	a likely mechanism for the observed `loss' of current. Hydrogen is
	the normal operating gas: other gases (D<sub>2</sub> and He) have
	been used, but the current drive is found to be less effective than
	in H<sub>2</sub>, with lower toroidal current maintained in the annulus},

  abstract  = {A model is suggested that predicts the velocity and geometrical characteristics
	of the plasma rotation in the Livermore spheromak. The model addresses
	the "good confinement" regimes in this device, where the typical
	length of the magnetic field lines before their intersection with
	the wall (this length is called "connection length" below) becomes
	large enough to make the parallel heat loss insignificant. In such
	regimes, the heat flux is determined by the transport across toroidally
	averaged flux surfaces. The model is based on the assumption that,
	entering the good confinement regime, does not automatically mean
	that the connection length becomes infinite, and perfect flux surfaces
	are established. It is hypothesized that connection length remains
	finite, albeit large in regard to the parallel heat loss. The field
	lines are threading the whole plasma volume, although it takes a
	long distance for them to get from one toroidally averaged flux surface
	to another. The parallel electron momentum balance then uniquely
	determines the distribution of the electrostatic potential between
	these surfaces. An analysis of viscous stresses shows that the toroidal
	flow is much faster than the poloidal flow. It is shown that the
	rotation shear is usually exceeded by a factor of a few of the characteristic
	growth rates of drift waves, meaning that suppression of the transport
	caused by the drift turbulence may occur, and a transport barrier
	with respect to this transport mechanism may be formed. The model
	may be useful for assessing the plasma rotation in other spheromaks
	and, possibly, reversed-field pinches and field-reversed configurations,
	provided a certain set of applicability conditions (Sec. II) is fulfilled},

  abstract  = {The current density on the open field lines of the Livermore spheromak
	(SSPX) typically exceeds the saturation current density of the bulk
	plasma. We assume that the mechanism that provides conditions for
	that is associated with the formation of a thin layer near the cathode
	surface, where both the plasma and the neutral density are higher
	than in the bulk plasma and where intense ionization occurs. The
	ions formed in this layer fall back onto the cathode, whereas electrons
	contribute to the high current density in the bulk plasma. The particle
	balance in the ionizing layer is determined by the recycling coefficient,
	which, in turn, depends on the cathode temperature and the sheath
	voltage. As it turns out, these dependences give rise to an instability
	that leads to the current filamentation and the formation of hot
	spots on the cathode surface. The instability can be characterized
	in a phenomenological manner without going into the details of the
	structure of the ionizing layer whose effect on the instability shows
	up in the form of a couple of numerical coefficients of the order
	of one. We predict the characteristic size and the shape of the filaments
	(and the hot spots), which are in a general agreement with discoloration
	patterns on the surface of the cathode in the SSPX. If the magnetic
	field is tilted to the surface, the footpoints of the filaments move
	with a significant velocity, whose direction depends on the ratio
	of the ion gyroradius and the thickness of the ionizing layer. This
	instability, although primarily considered in conjunction with the
	SSPX experiment, may play a role in spherical tokamaks and other
	systems with coaxial helicity injection},

	rotational self-forces that amplify its toroidal current, and hence
	its poloidal magnetic field. This result explains the experimentally
	observed increase of toroidal current in free compact toroidal plasmas.
	The possibility of an axisymmetric spherical dynamo that generates
	its own dipole-like self-field is mentioned},

  abstract  = {The evolution of a low beta spheromak initially in a two-dimensional
	stable equilibrium having a constant <i>J</i>/<i>B</i> (the so-called
	minimum energy state) is calculated within the context of resistive
	magnetohydrodynamics. Since the initial equilibrium is stable, the
	spheromak at first resistively evolves through a sequence of stable
	quasiequilibria. This phase of the evolution is calculated with a
	transport code in which the resistivity is assumed to be largest
	at the wall and lowest at the magnetic axis. Resistive diffusion
	causes the safety factor <i>q</i> to decrease everywhere while decreasing
	fastest near the wall. The quasiequilibria through which the spheromak
	evolves are tested for stability with both an ideal linear stability
	code and a resistive one. The results of both stability codes are
	in basic agreement and show that when <i>q</i> drops to below 1/2
	everywhere the spheromak becomes unstable to an <i>n</i>=2 mode.
	The agreement of the stability codes implies that the unstable mode
	is a resistively modified ideal mode. The unstable equilibrium is
	used as the initial condition in a 3-D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic
	simulation. This shows that after the unstable mode saturates, the
	spheromak resistively evolves through a sequence of three-dimensional
	quasiequilibria until it reaches another unstable configuration,
	after which it approaches the 2-D minimum energy state again. This
	evolutionary cycle can conceivably start again, unless the cycle
	time becomes comparable to the configuration decay time. One consequence
	of the cycle is that as the 3-D spheromak approaches the minimum
	energy state, the magnetic axis and hot plasma near it approach the
	wall and a new magnetic axis is formed. At high enough <i>S</i>,
	when the cycle time is comparable to the configuration lifetime,
	this convective heat loss mechanism is minimized. The 3-D code predicts
	that only the <i>n</i>=0 and <i>n</i>=2 modes are active. Simulations
	in which the <i>n</i>=1, 3, and 4 modes are present show that these
	modes decay while the <i>n</i>=2 grows and saturates. Closed flux
	surfaces are present over most of the domain so that heat loss along
	stochastic field lines should not be large. When the Hall term is
	included a toroidal rotation of the magnetic configuration is induced},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. The most successful approach for generating
	the spheromak magnetic confinement configuration is through electrostatic
	helicity injection. A large arc discharge forms the spheromak by
	stretching, reconnecting, and amplifying a small amount of externally
	generated poloidal flux. The details of the inherent plasma relaxation
	processes are being investigated through nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics
	(MHD) simulation. Our previous work considers the low-pressure limit
	of MHD and shows that plasma current driven by the electrodes pinches
	and forms a configuration that is unstable to an n=1 mode. Amplification
	of poloidal flux results from the saturation of this MHD mode. With
	continuously applied current drive, magnetic field-line trajectories
	are chaotic, due to the n=1 mode and nonlinearly generated n&gt;1
	fluctuations. When the drive is removed, however, the fluctuations
	decay faster than the large-scale amplified poloidal flux, and closed
	magnetic flux surfaces form. Recent computations include temperature
	evolution with thermal transport coefficients and electrical resistivity
	that are appropriate for collisional plasmas. The temperature dependencies
	of these coefficients produce striking effects in the simulated spheromak
	evolution. The cold edge plasma tends to impede parallel thermal
	conduction to the wall in sustained conditions, allowing the plasma
	core temperature to reach tens of eVs. When the drive is removed,
	the cold edge plasma assists magnetic reconnection, so that closed
	flux surfaces form rapidly, and core temperatures increase to approximately
	100 eV. The finite temperature computations have been performed in
	conditions that are realistic for the SSPX spheromak at LLNL, and
	simulation results on magnetic field and temperature evolution are
	compared directly with laboratory measurements. The comparison highlights
	the importance of transient effects in partially sustained conditions
	and helps analyze the beneficial effects of applying the second voltage
	pulse},

	injection current drive by solving a set of resistive magnetohydrodynamic
	(MHD) equations in a circular, cylindrical configuration. Two of
	their results are that (1) current penetration is incomplete, and
	(2) penetration is accompanied by magnetic fluctuations with amplitude
	of order 1%. They believe the chosen MHD equations are highly relevant
	for two reasons. First, the resistive MHD equations are the basis
	for the Taylor relaxation and helicity balance arguments that underlie
	the proposals for a DC helicity injected tokamak. Second, the equations
	and code that they employ have provided enormous insight into current
	profile relaxation and fluctuations in related situations, such as
	the reversed field pinch. The comment by Jarboe et al. (1997) reports
	no error in the computation of any of their physics results. Their
	comment is devoted to a speculation that additional effects (toroidicity,
	Hall and rotamak effects, and Lundquist number scaling) will greatly
	and positively alter the two physics results cited above. Although
	Jarboe et al. present neither experimental nor theoretical results
	to support their claims, Sovinec and Prager have no quarrel with

	Artificial hyper-dissipation mechanisms are being explored to lessen

  abstract  = {The most successful approach for generating the spheromak magnetic
	confinement configuration is through electrostatic helicity injection.
	A large arc discharge forms the spheromak by stretching, reconnecting,
	and amplifying a small amount of externally generated poloidal flux.
	The details of the inherent plasma relaxation processes are being
	investigated through nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation.
	Our previous work considers the low-pressure limit of MHD and shows
	that plasma current driven by the electrodes pinches and forms a
	configuration that is unstable to an n=1 mode. Amplification of poloidal
	flux results from the saturation of this MHD mode. With continuously
	applied current drive, magnetic field-line trajectories are chaotic,
	due to the n=1 mode and nonlinearly generated n&gt;1 fluctuations.
	When the drive is removed, however, the fluctuations decay faster
	than the large-scale amplified poloidal flux, and closed magnetic
	flux surfaces form. Recent computations include temperature evolution
	with thermal transport coefficients and electrical resistivity that
	are appropriate for collisional plasmas. The temperature dependencies
	of these coefficients produce striking effects in the simulated spheromak
	evolution. The cold edge plasma tends to impede parallel thermal
	conduction to the wall in sustained conditions, allowing the plasma
	core temperature to reach tens of eVs. When the drive is removed,
	the cold edge plasma assists magnetic reconnection, so that closed
	flux surfaces form rapidly, and core temperatures increase to approximately
	100 eV. The finite temperature computations have been performed in
	conditions that are realistic for the SSPX spheromak at LLNL, and
	simulation results on magnetic field and temperature evolution are
	compared directly with laboratory measurements. The comparison highlights
	the importance of transient effects in partially sustained conditions
	and helps analyze the beneficial effects of applying the second voltage
	pulse.},

	proposed and investigated in the context of spheromaks [D. D. Ryutov,
	Phys. Plasmas 14, 022506 (2007)]. The opening up of internal magnetic
	field lines serves to regulate the electrostatic potential in the
	interior of the plasma, and in turn drives ion rotation. In effect,
	&ldquo;end-shorting,&rdquo; a well-known phenomenon in the FRC scrape-off
	layer, also extends into the plasma interior. For conditions relevant
	to experiments, the ion rotation can be expressed in terms of equilibrium
	properties (density and temperature gradients) and as such is the
	&ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo; rotation. This theory is incomplete in
	that it neglects evolving, transport-related effects that modify
	the equilibrium and, indirectly, the rotation rate. Consequently,
	the equilibrium rotation theory is only partially successful in predicting
	experimental results: although it predicts the average rotation well,
	the estimated degree of rotational shear seems unlikely, especially
	at late times in the plasma lifetime.},

	state with uniform density. Flowing equilibria are found to fall
	into two classes, <i>force-free</i> and <i>non-force-free</i>, referring
	to the absence or presence of a <b>j&times;B</b> force. The force-free
	class may have significant flows. Spheromaks are in this class. The
	non-force-free class is diamagnetic and has Alfv&eacute;nic poloidal

	classes admit arbitrarily large equilibria. Both classes occupy certain
	&ldquo;allowed&rdquo; regions in &ldquo;helicity space,&rdquo; a
	two-dimensional parameter map with the electron and ion helicities
	as coordinates. Allowed regions for the two classes overlap; in the
	overlap region the non-force-free class is energetically favorable.
	This sheds light on the FRC-spheromak bifurcation observed in experiments.
	Two-dimensional analytic equilibria are also found that span both

	magnetic field are fixed on the boundary wall in the simulation,
	the deceleration caused by the magnetic tension force would be overestimated.
	In the present study, the dependence of the boundary condition of
	the target magnetic field on the SCT penetration process is examined.
	On the basis of these results, the theoretical model previously proposed
	is improved to include the effect that the fluctuations of the target
	magnetic field propagate with the Alfven velocity. In addition, by
	carrying out the simulation with the torus domain, it is confirmed
	that the theoretical model can be applied to estimate the penetration
	depth of the SCT under such conditions. The dependence of the injection
	position (side injection and top/bottom injection) on the penetration
	process is also examined},

	a far more robust reactor engineering design if a plasma center column
	(PCC) can be used in place of a material center post. Biased electrodes
	across the plasma center column would drive a plasma current to produce
	the toroidal magnetic field in lieu of the toroidal field (TF) coils.
	The operation of such a device is naturally divided into two distinct
	phases: formation by driven relaxation under magnetic helicity injection
	and sustainment by auxiliary current drive and heating such as rf
	and neutral beam injection (NBI). The initial design constraints
	of a ST-PCC experiment are primarily motivated by the formation rather
	than the sustainment physics. With a Taylor-relaxed plasma as the
	baseline case, it is shown that three essential factors guide the
	design. First, the flux amplification factor determines the aspect
	ratio of the ST-PCC. Second, the plasma shaping in general and plasma
	elongation in particular gives the most freedom in shaping the q
	profile of the relaxed plasma. Two examples are the standard spherical
	tokamak with q&gt;1 throughout the plasma and the ultralow q (ULQ)
	spherical tokamak with q much less than unity for the bulk of the

	important role in modifying the q profile. As an example, it is shown
	how the bias flux can be designed to delineate a standard spheromak
	experiment from that of an ULQ ST-PCC. These physics understandings
	help define the design space of the ST-PCC experiments and directions

  abstract = {For several decades, the notion of compression of plasma to fusion
	conditions by liner implosion has been pursued by several groups.
	This quest has often achieved success with some form of liner implosion
	technology, but not in the actual compression of plasma. Several
	plasma targets have been proposed, ranging from plasma magnetized
	to reduce heat transfer, but mechanically- supported by the liner,
	to plasmas confined and supported by magnetic field, in some configuration
	of open and closed field-lines. In all cases, the principal issue
	remains one of preventing the high atomic-number material of the
	liner from penetrating the plasma and countering the gain in plasma
	temperature sought by compression. Two factors foster development
	of such deleterious penetration: the creation of a liquid/vapor layer
	at the liner surface at high magnetic fields, and disruption of this
	layer by Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the final stages of plasma
	compression. The latter factor, of course, depends on the desired
	efficiency of energy transfer from liner kinetic energy to the plasma.
	In reactor concepts, the efficiency needs to be high in order to
	reduce the total system energy and size to attractive values. Within
	a general review of issues of liner compression of plasma, we discuss
	reactor cost optimization by use of plasma at pressures intermediate
	between the values of conventional magnetically- or inertially-confined
	fusion concepts. We also describe the development of an equilibrium
	layer of vapor adjacent to the liner surface at high magnetic fields,
	and the consequences of liner deceleration and rebound for reactor
	concepts and research progress. &copy; 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {A computational method is proposed for solving magnetohydrodynamical
	equilibrium problems with prescribed flux and mass within the magnetic
	surfaces that foliate the plasma. Such problems arise in tokamak
	modeling, for instance, where they determine either equilibria with
	given adiabatic profiles or slowly evolving quasi-equilibria governed
	by the Grad-Hogan equations. The classical variational principles
	of Kruskal and Kulsrud (1958) and Woltjer(1959), which express these
	problems in terms of energy minimization subject to infinite families
	of nonlinear, nonlocal constraints, are taken as the basis for a
	direct method of solution. A natural discretization of the classical
	constraint families is devised, and an iterative algorithm is developed
	to solve the resulting optimization problems. A convergence theory
	for the algorithm is established, and an effective numerical implementation
	of the method is presented for flux-conserving tokamak equilibria.
	Some computed examples involving plasma heating and adiabatic compression
	are described},

  abstract = {Magnetic stochasticity produced by nonlinear interactions of large
	amplitude resistive tearing instabilities is believed to be the primary
	cause of the anomalous transport in a reversed field pinch. The amplitudes
	of these instabilities can be reduced by modifying (i.e., flattening)
	the poloidal current profile in the outer region (0.6a&lt;r&lt;a)
	of the plasma and this would in turn increase the energy confinement
	time. Such an improvement has been observed in the pulsed poloidal
	current drive experimental and also in numerical results utilizing
	the 3D resistive MHD code DEBS. To sustain an improved confinement
	state, it is desirable to employ an active control method which is
	noninvasive and nontransient. To this end, we are studying the use
	of radio frequency current drive in the poloidal direction. One promising
	candidate is lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in a frequency range
	of 2-3f<sub>LH</sub>. Analytic estimates, neglecting toroidal magnetic
	shear, suggest that, in a typical MST discharge, the slow wave of
	frequency f=200-300 MHz with n<sub>&par;</sub>~10 would penetrate
	to r~0.6-0.7a after making two to three poloidal turns. In this zone
	the electron temperature T<sub>e</sub> = 150-200 eV and electron
	density n<sub>e</sub>=6~8&times;10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>,
	and significant electron Landau damping can be expected. The current
	drive efficiency could be as high as 0.4 A/W. To refine our analysis,
	we modify a version of Brambilla's ray tracing code for the tokamak
	to accommodate the reversed field pinch configuration. Preliminary
	ray tracing results, suppressing toroidal magnetic field variations,
	are consistent with the analytic estimates. Ray tracing results are
	coupled to the 3-D Fokker-Planck code CQL3D and to the 3-D resistive
	MHD code DEBS. Effects of a driven current on the large amplitude
	tearing fluctuations are examined},

	study the interaction of their initial internal field (depending
	on the orientation of their axes) with the ambient interplanetary
	magnetic field and their three-dimensional structure near 1 AU. It
	is shown by the simulation that a spheromak with a poloidal field
	expands into a toroid during its propagation. It develops into an
	oblate shape by virtue of its momentum interaction with the solar
	wind. Draping of magnetic field lines around it causes its polar
	axis (evolving into the toroid's hole) to be aligned with the radial
	direction irrespective of its initial orientation. This means that
	a hypothetical spacecraft can cross the resulting toroid only once,
	thereby observing signatures similar to a flux rope crossing. Double
	crossings are excluded even near the Sun (0.3 AU). Therefore the
	observations of magnetic clouds which resemble a double flux rope
	crossing must be explained in a way other than within the spheromak

	was devoted to simulations of the propagation of cylindrical magnetic
	clouds (flux ropes) having a different orientation of their axes
	to the ecliptic plane and initial parameters. In this paper we supplement
	our study with the case of detached spherical plasmoids. By varying
	the velocity, density, temperature, and the magnetic field strength
	inside clouds, we simulate a number of plasmoid scenarios that can
	be compared with observations and with existing models and simulations
	of flux ropes. Initially, the spherical clouds have a poloidal magnetic
	field configuration within a sphere. During the propagation they
	evolve into toroids (i.e., closed flux ropes). Radial profiles of
	magnetic field and plasma quantities in these toroids are similar
	to cylindrical magnetic clouds. However, they are different in the
	central (now external) part of the cloud, where the poloidal axis
	was originally situated, that is, in the toroid's hole. Here the
	magnetic field is greatly enhanced but does not rotate, and the temperature
	decrease is absent. The deceleration and transit time to 1 AU is
	comparable between spherical and cylindrical clouds. The shock wave
	ahead of a spherical cloud is about 2 times closer than for a corresponding
	cylindrical cloud},

  abstract  = {The US fusion program has operated for just over 50 years, during

	for a burning plasma experiment. However, many other concepts have
	been built and investigated as alternatives (and possible improvements)
	to the tokamak, perhaps to make energy from fusion an economic reality
	sooner. This Paper is an overview of the conventional alternatives
	to the tokamak and a set of those that are not so conventional with
	the aim of fostering concept innovation. Usually the devices are
	grouped into magnetic, inertial, electrostatic, or other categories,
	with sub-categories. Here, the groupings of conventionaland non-conventional-alternatives
	are used too. The conventional alternatives are those devices that
	have been adopted as serious alternatives, and for which many references
	are immediately available (e.g. rfp, mirror, stellarator, spheromak,
	laser ICF, etc). The non-conventional alternatives comprise approaches
	that are not being currently investigated or are worth consideration.
	In this grouping lie ideas like impact fusion, muon catalyzed fusion,
	and many historical ones (like the Elmo Bumpy Torus). Several examples
	of the physics of non-conventional alternatives are presented in
	summary form as examples of skunkworks in the hope that others will

  journal = {Journal of Fusion Energy},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {1 - 12},
  abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and
	whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history
	has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues
	to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market
	for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20&nbsp;+&nbsp;year)
	plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster
	commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities,
	and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E).
	There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can
	be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how
	compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by
	optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating
	not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some
	components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier
	to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost,
	practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the
	constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private
	sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE
	Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle
	development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact
	and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology
	commercialization path. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media,

	D. Pearlstein, and D. D. Ryutov, Nucl. Fusion 39, 863 (1999)], progress
	has been made in understanding the mechanisms that generate fields
	by helicity injection. SSPX injects helicity (linked magnetic flux)
	from 1 m diameter magnetized coaxial electrodes into a flux-conserving
	confinement region. Control of magnetic fluctuations (&delta;B/B~1\%
	on the midplane edge) yields T<sub>e</sub> profiles peaked at &gt;200
	eV. Trends indicate a limiting beta (&beta;<sub>e</sub>~4\%-6\%),
	and so we have been motivated to increase T<sub>e</sub> by operating
	with stronger magnetic field. Two new operating modes are observed
	to increase the magnetic field: (A) Operation with constant current
	and spontaneous gun voltage fluctuations. In this case, the gun is
	operated continuously at the threshold for ejection of plasma from
	the gun: stored magnetic energy of the spheromak increases gradually
	with &delta;B/B~2\% and large voltage fluctuations (&delta;V~1 kV),
	giving a 50\% increase in current amplification, I<sub>tor</sub>/I<sub>gun</sub>.
	(B) Operation with controlled current pulses. In this case, spheromak
	magnetic energy increases in a stepwise fashion by pulsing the gun,
	giving the highest magnetic fields observed for SSPX (~0.7 T along
	the geometric axis). By increasing the time between pulses, a quasisteady
	sustainment is produced (with periodic good confinement), comparing
	well with resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In each case,
	the processes that transport the helicity into the spheromak are
	inductive and exhibit a scaling of field with current that exceeds
	those previously obtained. We use our newly found scaling to suggest
	how to achieve higher temperatures with a series of pulses},

	offering the advantages of a cylindrical geometry, a natural divertor
	and the possibility of axial movement of the confined plasma during
	the formation/burn cycle. The essential techniques of FRC formation,
	translation and magnetic compression heating have been successfully
	demonstrated, and gross instabilities driven by plasma rotation have
	been controlled. Emphasis of present FRC research is on formation
	symmetry, and on the effects of reducing the large gyroradii of the
	ions on stability and confinement. The spheromak, like the reversed
	field pinch, embodies a nearly force-free equilibrium whose evolution
	is governed significantly by the principle that magnetic helicity
	is conserved during relaxation processes that minimize magnetic energy.
	Recent spheromak research has shown how improved edge conditions
	can enhance global confinement by reducing relaxation and turbulence.
	Attention to this issue has led to major gains in spheromak energy
	confinement and plasma beta, and to the discovery of new pressure

	strength; ultimately, field, high as 10 T may be desired. To facilitate
	the production of small, high-field spheromaks, the following changes
	to CTX have been made: (a) a new solid-wall flux conserver with a
	radius of 0.28 m (roughly half the previously used 0.61-m radius)
	has been installed and (b) the external capacitor bank circuit has
	been changed to give shorter (&ap;0.18-ms), higher-power pulses to
	the pulses to the plasma gun. The highest maximum internal field
	obtained to date is &ap;3.5 T, but the majority of the data obtained
	thus far are from spheromaks with &ap;2.2-2.6-T maximum internal

	1407 (1982)] was performed to extend the investigation of confinement
	properties of the spheromak to plasmas with larger current density
	and higher plasma pressure than obtained before. Evolution of the
	magnetic configuration was mapped using internal-probe-based flux
	plots, and it was found that the plasma compression was approximately
	self-similar. The Taylor equilibrium state was maintained without
	flux conversion or relaxation phenomena. With a compression factor
	of up to 1.6, a significant increase of plasma pressure was observed.
	The peak electron temperature rose from approximately 40 eV before
	compression to about 100 eV, and the peak density increased somewhat
	less than the adiabaticity based scaling, which suggests the presence
	of an enhanced particle loss mechanism. In general, the electron's
	beta value was approximately constant during the compression; that
	is, <i>n</i><sub>e0</sub><i>T</i><sub>e0</sub>&prop;<i>B</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>.
	This result is consistent with the S-1 scaling obtained earlier without
	compression. The ion temperature measured by Doppler broadening of

	the global MHD stability characteristics of the plasmas formed by

  abstract  = {We investigate experimentally and theoretically the global MHD characteristics
	of an Ultra-Low Aspect Ratio Tokamak (ULART). Since the ULART requires
	a substantially smaller toroidal field current, I<sub>tf</sub>, than
	conventional tokamaks, it has important reactor advantages. By fully
	utilizing the TS-3 merging spheromak facility with a slender center
	conductor, we have carried out an experimental study of the ultra-low
	aspect ratio tokamak with aspect ratio reaching as low as 1.05. The
	ULART is found to be similar to the spheromak in its strong paramagnetism
	and magnetic helical pitch. In this extreme limit, we investigate
	the transition of the spheromak (q<sub>a</sub>=0, I<sub>tf</sub>=0)
	to a ULART plasma (q<sub>a</sub>=5-20, I<sub>tf</sub>&lt;I<sub>p</sub>).
	It is observed that a small current at the center conductor can significantly
	improve the overall stability of the formed plasmas by effectively
	stabilizing the tilt mode. We identify a threshold of I<sub>tf</sub>&Lt;I<sub>p</sub>
	with q<sub>cyl</sub>(a)&Lt;1 for global tilt/shift modes. This initial
	observation is in agreement with a global MHD theory},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. In this work, we present an alternative solution,
	which is a gyrotron operating in the second harmonic. For operation
	in the second harmonic, a magnetic field of only about 3 kGauss is
	necessary. At frequencies as low as 15 GHz, 1 MW power can be produced
	even in the case of operation at low-order modes such as the TE<sub>02</sub>-mode.
	Assuming 50% efficiency possible, an electron beam with nominal voltage
	and current of 80 kV and 25 A, respectively, is chosen to produce
	1 MW of power. For a magnetron type electron gun the magnetic compression
	ratio based on the adiabatic theory should be close to 4.5, which
	is quite small for gyrotrons. Hence, the transition region between
	the gun and the resonator should be short. The beam produced for
	such short optics can be very stable with respect to the instabilities
	caused by the beam space charge. Based on the fact that the beam
	is stable as well as results from previous experiments with second
	harmonic gyrotrons at long wavelengths, an orbital-to-axial electron
	velocity of 2 is assumed. Detailed calculations are being done using
	the self-consistent code MAGY that include the effect of cavity wall
	profile and the magnetic field tapering on the gyrotron efficiency
	and power. It was found that second harmonic gyrotron with an optimized
	cavity wall profile can operate with more than 50% efficiency even
	in a constant magnetic field (about 2.925 kG)},

	regimes of line-tied g modes in slab geometry and ballooning instabilities
	in toroidal configurations. Recent experimental observation and numerical
	simulations demonstrate a persistence of ballooning-like filamentary
	structures well into the nonlinear stage of edge localized mode (ELM)
	activity in H-mode plasmas. Our theory is based on an expansion using
	two small scale lengths, the mode displacement across magnetic flux
	surfaces and the mode width in the most rapidly varying direction,
	both normalized by the equilibrium scale length. When the mode displacement
	across the magnetic flux surface is much less than the mode width
	in the most rapidly varying direction, the mode is in the linear
	regime. When the mode displacement grows to the order of the mode
	width in the rapidly varying direction, the plasma remains incompressible
	to lowest order, and the Cowley-Artun regime is obtained. The detonation
	regime, where the nonlinear growth of the mode could be finite-time
	singular, is accessible when the system is sufficiently close to
	marginal stability. At higher levels of nonlinearity, the system
	evolves to the intermediate nonlinear regime, when the mode displacement
	across the magnetic flux surface becomes comparable to the mode width
	in the same direction. During this phase, the nonlinear growth of
	the mode in the parallel and perpendicular directions are coupled,
	and sound wave physics contributes to nonlinear stability. The governing
	equations for the line-tied g mode and the ballooning instability
	in the intermediate nonlinear regime have been derived. A remarkable
	feature of the nonlinear equations is that solutions of the associated
	local linear mode equations continue to be valid solutions into the
	intermediate nonlinear regime in a Lagrangian reference frame. This
	property has been confirmed in the full ideal MHD simulations of
	both the line-tied g mode in a shearless slab and the ballooning
	instability in a tokamak, and may help explain the growth and persistence
	of the filamentary structures observed in ELM experiments well into

  abstract = {A comprehensive, long-time-scale simulation of a tokamak requires
	that many physical processes (turbulent fluctuations, core transport,
	edge transport, MHD equilibrium, various sources, etc.) be modeled
	and consistently coupled together. These processes vary in length-
	and time-scale, and in dimensionality. We are developing algorithms
	for coupling such processes in a manner that allows each to be advanced
	on the relevant time-scale. In particular, the goal is to advance
	the transport equations with a time-step on the order of the energy
	confinement time. Our methods are being tested by developing a prototype
	simulation code, CORSICA. This code is being constructed by taking
	existing codes and coupling them together as modules in a single
	code. The three main focuses of the project are: (1) coupling a 1-D
	core transport code to an axisymmetric free-boundary MHD equilibrium
	code (LLNL's TEQ) and to circuit equations for the poloidal field
	coils and passive structure (the resulting 1-1/2 D transport code
	is known as CORSICA 1.0); (2) coupling the core transport code to
	a 2-D edge transport code (UEDGE); and (3) coupling the transport
	codes to turbulence simulation codes. Progress in all three of these
	areas will be discussed, including: early results from CORSICA 1.0;
	an algorithm for coupling turbulence simulation fluxes into a transport
	code; results from coupling local and nonlocal Hasegawa-Wakatani
	turbulence simulation codes to a 1-D slab transport code, including
	discussion of local versus nonlocal transport; and time-dependent
	results from coupling the UEDGE edge code to a 1-D slab (&ldquo;core&rdquo;)
	transport code},

  title = {Path to Market for Compact Modular Fusion Power Cores},
  journal = {Journal of Fusion Energy},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {1 - 12},
  abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and
	whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history
	has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues
	to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market
	for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20&nbsp;+&nbsp;year)
	plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster
	commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities,
	and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E).
	There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can
	be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how
	compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by
	optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating
	not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some
	components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier
	to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost,
	practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the
	constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private
	sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE
	Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle
	development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact
	and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology
	commercialization path. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media,

  title = {Path to Market for Compact Modular Fusion Power Cores},
  journal = {Journal of Fusion Energy},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {1 - 12},
  abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and
	whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history
	has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues
	to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market
	for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20&nbsp;+&nbsp;year)
	plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster
	commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities,
	and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E).
	There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can
	be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how
	compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by
	optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating
	not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some
	components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier
	to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost,
	practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the
	constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private
	sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE
	Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle
	development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact
	and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology
	commercialization path. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media,

  abstract = {A compact torus (CT) has a toroidal magnetic and plasma geometry,
	but is contained within a simply-connected vacuum vessel such as
	a cylinder. Spheromaks and field-reversed configurations fall into
	this category. Compact tori are translatable and have a high engineering
	beta. The primary benefit of CTs for fusion is the absence of toroidal
	field and Ohmic Heating coils and the many problems brought on by
	them. Studying fusion-relevant plasma in simply-connected geometries
	affords the world fusion program both physics and technology opportunities
	not found in other configurations. This paper outlines the technology
	and physics opportunities of compact tori, and presents a cost model
	based on geometry for comparison with less compact configurations.

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {A fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) could play an important role in the development of fusion energy by providing the nuclear environment needed to develop fusion materials and components. The spherical torus/tokamak (ST) is a leading candidate for an FNSF due to its potentially high neutron wall loading and modular configuration. A key consideration for the choice of FNSF configuration is the range of achievable missions as a function of device size. Possible missions include: providing high neutron wall loading and fluence, demonstrating tritium self-sufficiency, and demonstrating electrical self-sufficiency. All of these missions must also be compatible with a viable divertor, first-wall, and blanket solution. ST-FNSF configurations have been developed simultaneously incorporating for the first time: (1) a blanket system capable of tritium breeding ratio TBR?????1, (2) a poloidal field coil set supporting high elongation and triangularity for a range of internal inductance and normalized beta values consistent with NSTX/NSTX-U previous/planned operation, (3) a long-legged divertor analogous to the MAST-U divertor which substantially reduces projected peak divertor heat-flux and has all outboard poloidal field coils outside the vacuum chamber and superconducting to reduce power consumption, and (4) a vertical maintenance scheme in which blanket structures and the centerstack can be removed independently. Progress in these ST-FNSF missions versus configuration studies including dependence on plasma major radius R0 for a range 1 mï¿œ2.2 m are described. In particular, it is found the threshold major radius for TBR??=??1 is m, and a smaller R0??=??1 m ST device has TBR?????0.9 which is below unity but substantially reduces T consumption relative to not breeding. Calculations of neutral beam heating and current drive for non-inductive ramp-up and sustainment are described. An A??=??2, R0??=??3 m device incorporating high-temperature superconductor toroidal field coil magnets capable of high neutron fluence and both tritium and electrical self-sufficiency is also presented following systematic aspect ratio studies.}

  title = {Path to Market for Compact Modular Fusion Power Cores},
  journal = {Journal of Fusion Energy},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {1 - 12},
  abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and
	whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history
	has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues
	to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market
	for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20&nbsp;+&nbsp;year)
	plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster
	commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities,
	and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E).
	There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can
	be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how
	compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by
	optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating
	not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some
	components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier
	to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost,
	practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the
	constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private
	sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE
	Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle
	development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact
	and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology
	commercialization path. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media,

  pages = {1 - 7},
  abstract = {A compact torus (CT) has a toroidal magnetic and plasma geometry,
	but is contained within a simply-connected vacuum vessel such as
	a cylinder. Spheromaks and field-reversed configurations fall into
	this category. Compact tori are translatable and have a high engineering
	beta. The primary benefit of CTs for fusion is the absence of toroidal
	field and Ohmic Heating coils and the many problems brought on by
	them. Studying fusion-relevant plasma in simply-connected geometries
	affords the world fusion program both physics and technology opportunities
	not found in other configurations. This paper outlines the technology
	and physics opportunities of compact tori, and presents a cost model
	based on geometry for comparison with less compact configurations.

  title = {Path to Market for Compact Modular Fusion Power Cores},
  journal = {Journal of Fusion Energy},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {1 - 12},
  abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and
	whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history
	has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues
	to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market
	for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20&nbsp;+&nbsp;year)
	plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster
	commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities,
	and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E).
	There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can
	be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how
	compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by
	optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating
	not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some
	components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier
	to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost,
	practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the
	constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private
	sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE
	Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle
	development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact
	and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology
	commercialization path. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media,

  abstract = {A compact torus (CT) has a toroidal magnetic and plasma geometry,
	but is contained within a simply-connected vacuum vessel such as
	a cylinder. Spheromaks and field-reversed configurations fall into
	this category. Compact tori are translatable and have a high engineering
	beta. The primary benefit of CTs for fusion is the absence of toroidal
	field and Ohmic Heating coils and the many problems brought on by
	them. Studying fusion-relevant plasma in simply-connected geometries
	affords the world fusion program both physics and technology opportunities
	not found in other configurations. This paper outlines the technology
	and physics opportunities of compact tori, and presents a cost model
	based on geometry for comparison with less compact configurations.

  abstract={The Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment (SSPX) was a high-temperature ( T e up to 0.5Â keV) spheromak formed by coaxial helicity injection (CHI) and with plasma duration of a few milliseconds following the high-current formation stage. Clean walls and low impurity operation were obtained by a combination of baking, discharge cleaning and titanium deposition on the walls, allowing the generation of high-quality plasmas. Resistive-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, benchmarked to the experiment, were used to elucidate the physics. The detailed characteristics of the n ÏÂ =Â 1 toroidal mode associated with CHI were determined as was the physics of the nonlinear current drive and magnetic reconnection that formed and sustained the spheromak. If the helicity injection rate was reduced following formation the plasma became relatively quiescent and magnetic surfaces formed. The measured thermal diffusivity in the core was as low as âŒ1Â m 2Â s â1 . However, reconnection events during buildup or sustainment of the plasma current by CHI were found to open magnetic surfaces throughout the plasma allowing rapid energy loss to the walls. As a result, experiments and simulations in SSPX found no path to simultaneous sustainment by CHI and good energy confinement. Additional physics results are also presented in this review.}

  abstract    = {The economic goals of Generation IV nuclear energy systems, as adopted by the Generation IV
International Forum (GIF), are:
 to have a life cycle cost advantage over other energy sources (i.e., to have a lower levelized unit
cost of energy on average over their lifetime)
 to have a level of financial risk comparable to other energy projects (i.e., to involve similar total
capital investment and capital at risk).
The Economics Crosscut Group of the Generation IV Roadmap Project recommended that a
standardized cost estimating protocol be developed to provide decision makers with a credible basis to
assess, compare, and eventually select future nuclear energy systems, taking into account a robust
evaluation of their economic viability. The GIF accepted this recommendation and established the
Economic Modeling Working Group (EMWG) to develop this protocol.
This document provides a uniform set of assumptions, a uniform Code of Accounts (COA) and
cost-estimating guidelines to be used in developing cost estimates for advanced nuclear energy systems. It
discusses the development of all relevant life cycle costs for Generation IV systems, including the
planning, research, development, demonstration (including prototype), deployment, and commercial
stages.

Software models, G4-ECONS, accompany this document. The combination of the software and
guidelines facilitate the development of consistent, comprehensible cost estimates to be performed by the
system development teams as requested by the GIF Policy and Experts Groups.
The levelized unit of energy cost (LUEC) that is evaluated includes design, construction,
commissioning, operations and maintenance, fuel cycle, and decommissioning costs for the first-of-a-kind
(FOAK) through Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) commercial nuclear units. System development teams (System
Steering Committees) are expected to provide feedback to the EMWG on these cost estimating guidelines
and consult as needed with the EMWG when preparing cost and schedule estimates.},

It examines the future of the nuclear power industry and unpacks the complicated relationships between its technical, economic and political variables. It does so by modelling the costs, risks and uncertainties of one of the world’s most opaque industries using micro-econometrics, econometrics, and cost engineering.

Economics of Nuclear Power examines the very important costs of externalities (storing of nuclear waste and the impact of a Chernobyl or Fukushima event) and compares those to the externalities of alternative carbon based energies (oil, coal, natural gas). With over 100 tables and figures this book details nuclear power production around the world - present and planned, providing a completely global focus. It also includes an overview of the past 70 years of international nuclear power developments.},

  type        = {Tecdoc},
  abstract    = {The IAEA has prepared and published a series of technical reports to assist
Member States, particularly those which are developing countries, in making
comprehensive assessments for the deployment of nuclear power. A number of the
reports deal specifically with the bidding for and bid evaluation of nuclear power
plants, i.e. Bid Invitation Specifications for Nuclear Power Plants (1987); Technical
Evaluation of Bids for Nuclear Power Plants (1981); and Economic Evaluation of
Bids for Nuclear Power Plants (1986). The latter publication is a revised version of
the 1976 report bearing the same title.
The 1986 edition of the guidebook on the Economic Evaluation of Bids for
Nuclear Power Plants has been widely distributed to Member States in order to
facilitate economic and financial bid evaluation. It has been used as a basic textbook
for international, regional and national training courses and workshops on the subject.
Since the guidebook was last revised, substantial experience and feedback have been
gained through its use by Member States. Additionally, the bidding approaches,
contracting processes and financing arrangements for nuclear power projects have
become greatly diversified, and computer technology and software have undergone
significant development. In view of these developments, the contents, data and
computer program given in the 1986 edition guidebook have become outdated.
Consequently, the IAEA decided in November 1996 to update both the guidebook
and the computer program.
The updated report contains state of the art information, advice and
recommendations on the different principles, methods and guidelines which should
be used and applied when conducting an economic evaluation of nuclear power plant
bids. Also, an improved IAEA cost account system for nuclear power plants is listed
in Annex I.
In parallel with the revision of the guidebook, an improved and updated
software package for economic bid evaluation has been developed by Energoconsult
Praha of the Czech Republic under contract to the IAEA. The new software,
BIDEVAL-3, is based on advanced personal computer technology and is more
flexible and user-friendly than the previous version. A description of the new software
package is given in Annex II. The software package itself, including instructions for
its use, can be found on the CD-ROM accompanying this report.
This report should be useful to the managers, engineers, economists and
decision makers of electric utilities and governmental organizations in Member
States, particularly in developing countries. The report should also be helpful to the
suppliers of plant components and systems by providing a common framework for the
preparation of bids.
The IAEA wishes to express its thanks to all those who were involved in
reviewing the draft report and preparing the software, and to P.J. Meyer (Germany)
for his chairmanship of these meetings. The Technical Officer at the IAEA
responsible for the preparation of the updated report was Chuanwen Hu of the
Division of Nuclear Power.},

The Starfire conceptual design (1980) is the most detailed and best documented conceptual design and cost basis to date. The power plant had a very large power core, with high thermal output, relatively low thermal efficiency, and a net power of 1200 MWe. The Generomak reports (1986 & 1988) developed a basis for a parametric power plant design with modeling algorithms based largely on Starfire and a few other fusion conceptual plant designs. In 1992, four IFE power plant designs were completed, Prometheus-L, Prometheus-HI, Osiris, and Sombrero. An advisory commission for DOE developed a common set of costing guidelines for all four power plants to make sure all cost estimates were comparable and consistent. These studies are useful because the costing basis was well documented. Although these were inertial fusion energy (IFE) designs, much of the BOP and other systems are relevant to magnetic fusion energy (MFE). In the mid 90’s, the ARIES Project began a series of conceptual designs and costing analyses for fusion power plants, primarily commercial 10th-of-a-kind plants. These conceptual designs and cost data can be found on the ARIES web site. ARIES adopted much of the prior costing guidelines and bases for their usage, primarily from the Starfire and Generomak studies. The ARIES designs are fairly consistent, design to design, but the level of detail and documentation of the cost basis has been somewhat lacking. ARIES-SPPS final report provided some additional costing algorithms that were applied to the ARIES series of designs.},
