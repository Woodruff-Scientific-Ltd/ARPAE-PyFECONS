\subsubsection*{Cost Category 22.01.11: Assembly and Installation Costs}

Consists of: assembly and installation costs of components of the heat island from the first wall through to blanket and shield. Modular installation is assumed, namely parts are assembled into modules at a centralized manufacturing location and are shipped for installation. Costs are broken out by major subsystem as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost Category 22.01.11.01 First wall and blanket
    \item Cost Category 22.01.11.02 Shield
    \item Cost Category 22.01.11.03 Magnets
    \item Cost Category 22.01.11.04 Auxiliary Heating
