\subsubsection*{Cost Category 22.01.07: Power Supplies} 

This category covers an extensive range of power supply systems critical for operation. This includes High-Voltage Power Supplies for plasma heating, Pulsed Power Supply Systems for plasma initiation, and Superconducting Coil Power Supplies for magnetic confinement. Auxiliary Heating Power Supplies support additional plasma heating, while Cooling and Cryogenic Systems maintain optimal temperatures for superconducting components. 


\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost Category 22.07.01 High-Voltage Power Supplies. Essential for driving heating systems like neutral beam injectors, which heat the plasma to the necessary temperatures for fusion.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.02 Pulsed Power Supply Systems. These provide high-power electrical pulses required for plasma initiation and shaping.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.03 Coil Power Supplies: These are crucial for large superconducting magnets, and copper coils for equilibrium control.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.04 Auxiliary Heating Power Supplies. These are used for additional plasma heating systems like ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) and electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH).
    \item Cost Category 22.07.05 Cooling and Cryogenic Systems. To maintain the necessary low temperatures for the superconducting magnets and other components.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.06 Control and Instrumentation Power Supplies. For the myriad of sensors, diagnostics, and control systems involved in monitoring and controlling the fusion reactor.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.07 Power Conversion Systems for Plasma Heating. Such as gyrotrons for ECRH and klystrons or tetrodes for ICRH.
    \item Cost Category 22.07.08 Safety and Interlock Systems. To ensure safe operations, especially during abnormal events or emergencies, these systems can cut power or initiate shutdown sequences.
    \item Cost Category  22.07.09 Diagnostics and Monitoring Systems Power Supply. For real-time monitoring of plasma and reactor conditions, requiring reliable and clean power sources.

Capacitor banks are needed for plasma generation and compression systems. The typical lifetime of high voltage capacitors is 500,000 shots for full charge operations. However, the lifetime of the capacitors can be drastically increased by operating at lower voltages than the maximum specification, scaling with $(V_{\text{max}}/V_{\text{operating}})^7$. Figures \ref{fig:1}, \ref{fig:2}, and \ref{fig:3} show the effects of derating the voltage - shown in each case along the abscissa is the ratio of the applied to rated voltage, which is 1 if caps are charged to maximum rating; then, the lifetime extension factor is seen to increase sharply. This extension factor is converted into lifetime and plotted as years in Fig. \ref{fig:2}. 20 years seems optimal since caps will degrade due to sealing materials failing. A 20 years lifetime is approximately at a derated voltage ratio of 0.33. Looking at the cost scaling in Fig. \ref{fig:3}, it can be seen that at 0.33, the cost increase factor is 9. This is computed on the basis that capacitance remains fixed, and total stored energy remains the same, in which case cost scales with $(V_{\text{max}}/V_{\text{operating}})^2$. A cost factor of 9 is therefore applied to the capacitor cost. Since this is only $(392k/853k =)$ 46 percent of the total installed cost, a cost factor of 4.7 is applied to the total installed cost, effectively increasing the 0.25 \$/J obtained from our installed cost analysis, giving a derated installed cost of 1.17 \$/J.

Cost basis is taken from ITER for a 500MW fusion system, scaling the 269.6kIUA (1kIUA is 2MUSD), giving 539M USD for a 500MW fusion system. The total cost is C220107 M USD for a PNRL MW fusion system.
